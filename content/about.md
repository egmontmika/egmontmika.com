I am Egmont Mika, a teacher and a mentor, passionate about God and people.

Residence: Uppsala, Sweden / Family: Wife Ã…sa, five children, six grandchildren / Profession: Teacher of Art and German Language / Discipleship: Follower of Jesus, mentor, bible teacher, housechurch leader

### The Mission
This blog is based on Jesus' commission, Go out and make disciples of all nations.

Here, I am jotting down my personal thoughts on what it means to genuinely follow Jesus in every day living, to fulfill his mission and to form authentic communities of disciples.

Further, I am led by the conviction that discipleship is a calling for every believer - not only for professionals and not only in an institutional setting - and that every disciple of Jesus is authorized to lead others.

### The Method
I believe that this is best done through personal mentorship from person to person, one on one and one by one, and in connection with a small community or family of disciples.

I am regarding this method as the method that Jesus practiced himself when he trained his first disciples.

And inspite of impressive results of both megachurches and worldwide denominations, I still regard the one-on-one mentorship in combination with a small community of disciples as the most effective method for making disciples, both inside and outside any institutional frame.

### The Vision
Probably, this is the method that is best suited to create movements of disciples in any social, cultural and geographical context, and with only a minimum of material resources required.

The objective is to fulfill the vision that Jesus gave us, to let the gospel go viral and touch every human heart around the globe.
