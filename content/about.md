I am Egmont Mika, a teacher and a mentor, passionate about God and people.
Residence: Uppsala, Sweden / Family: Wife Åsa, five children, six grandchildren / Profession: Teacher of Art and German Language / Discipleship: Follower of Jesus, mentor, bible teacher, housechurch leader.

### The Mission
This blog is based on Jesus’ commission, Go out and make disciples of all nations.
Here, I will be jotting down my personal thoughts on what it means to genuinely follow Jesus in every day living, to fulfill his mission and to form authentic communities of disciples.
Further, I am led by the conviction that discipleship is a calling for every believer - not just for professionals - and that every disciple of Jesus is authorized to lead another person along that way.

### The Method
I believe that this is best done through personal mentorship from person to person, one on one and one by one, and in connection with a small community or family of disciples.
I am regarding this as the method that Jesus practiced himself when he trained his first disciples.
And inspite of many impressive results of both megachurches and great mission campaigns with tens and hundreds of thousands of participants, I still regard the one-on-one mentorship in combination with a small community of disciples as the most effective method for making disciples, both inside and outside any institutional framework.

### The Vision
Probably, this is also the way that is best suited to create movements of disciples in any social, cultural and geographical context, and with only a minimum of material resources required.
The objective is to fulfill the vision that Jesus gave us, to let the gospel go viral and touch every human heart around the globe.
