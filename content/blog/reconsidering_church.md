The status quo of the institutionalized church is powerful indeed.

And we try to keep it alive by small improvements here and there, fancier equipment, trendier arrangements, and popular speakers. We add layers, patches, and small improvisations, all to recover something we don't want to reconsider.

Yet, everything we do happens within the given institutional framework. 

We hardly question its basic structure, i. e., the institutional system, including constitutions, elections, offices, fundraising, buildings, and programs. And its division into clergy/professionals and laity.

If we could start all over again and could design something that actually would reflect the Kingdom of Heaven as proclaimed and put into practice by Jesus and the first century communities of disciples, what would we consider?

Here are some suggestions:

*Mission*

- The Great Commission as the church’s ultimate purpose

*Community*

- The overall character of church community as a family 
- Extended families and their homes as the basic units
- The spontaneous multiplication of these family communities as a movement

*Leadership*
- Spirit-filled and Spirit appointed leadership
- The general priesthood of all disciples

*Practice*
- The proclamation and demonstration of God’s kingdom in everyday life
- Seeking and saving the lost and training them as disciples
- Authoritative preaching and teaching followed by signs
- The working of the gifts of the Spirit

No matter, whether following a more traditional hierarchical or a more democratic system, 
institutional churches easily fall into the trap of worldly management and business behavior.

Therefore, let us from time to time consider the original assignment and, whenever there is an opportunity, take the chance to start over again. 

And do it better.
