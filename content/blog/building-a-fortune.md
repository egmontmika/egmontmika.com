The best fortune you can build is trust.

You build trust by saying what you do and by doing what you said. Keeping your promises. Living up to your words. Never doing less, rather a little more.

Without any hidden agenda, without cutting corners or faking the results, and without covering up your mistakes.

Without pretending.

Showing up on time - doing your work - completing it. Keeping your promises. 

No need to add more or better promises. Just keep the ones you already made.
No need to improve your image. Or compare yourself with others.

Just be the person you say you are.

In the long run, it will amount to much.
