The real fortune you can build is trust.

By saying what you are going to do - and then doing what you said. Never less, rather a little more.

Without any hidden agenda, without cutting corners or faking the results, and without covering up your mistakes.

Without pretending.

Showing up on time - doing your work - keeping your promises. Period.

No need to add more or bigger promises. Just keep the ones you already made.
No need to improve your image. Or compare yourself with others.

Just be the person you say you are.

That will amount to much.
