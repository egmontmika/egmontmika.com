The real fortune you can build is trust.

By saying what you are going to do - and then do what you said.

Without hidden agenda, without faking the results, without cutting corners, without covering up your mistakes.

Without pretending.

Showing up on time - doing your work - keeping your promises.

No need to add more promises. Or bigger promises. Just keep the ones you already made.

No need to improve your image. Or compare yourself with others.

Just be the person you say you are.

That will amount to much.
