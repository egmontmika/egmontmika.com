You can't buy trust.

Yet, it's one of the greatest fortunes you can gain.

At first glance, building trust seems simple. You say what you are going to do and then do what you said. You keep your promises. You act out your words. Never doing less, rather a little more.

Without any hidden agenda, without cutting corners. Without faking the results. And without covering up your mistakes.

Without pretending.

Showing up on time - doing your work - completing it. Period. 

No need to add more or better promises. Just keep the ones you already made.
No need to improve your image; it's not a matter of marketing. No need to compare yourself with others.

Just be the person you say you are.

It's simple, indeed, but not always easy. We hardly get it without effort an sometimes it takes great courage. And sometimes it just seems impossible, whenever you want to hide something.

In order to build a fortune of trust, you've got to be honest. Radically honest. This is the price you pay. And for a short while, it may look like you are loosing.

In the long run, though, it will pay and amount to much.
