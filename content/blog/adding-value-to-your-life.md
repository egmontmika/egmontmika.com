Life's value is not defined by the highlights.

Sunday worship services may leave the impression that living the Christian life is a series of meetings. Jumping from celebration to celebration. Like a butterfly, from flower to flower. Looking for the next sensation. The next spiritual experience.

Nothing could be more wrong than that.

Rather, it’s the other way around. The valuable life as a disciple of Jesus is the life you live in between the highlights. It’s your daily walk with Jesus. Every day, every hour, every minute. Seven days a week, twentyfour hours a day.

No part of your life is too low, not to be valuable. There is nothing to hide, nothing to be ashamed of, nothing unworthy; everything is under His Lordship. And under His grace. Everything is valuable.

In the Kingdom, there are no shadows. Everything is in the light. Also those times when you feel sweaty and dirty from work. Exhausted, and maybe discouraged. Every minute is valuable.

YOU are valuable.

One day, when you will look back and sum up your life, it will not be the highlights that added most value to your life, but your relationships. Your daily habits and your daily work. 

The results of your faithfulness and consistency. 

And your love.

What you did for others.
