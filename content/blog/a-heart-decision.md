You can’t argue a person into Heaven.

In spiritual matters arguing is futile. Even worse, it’s counterproductive. 
Each argument provokes at least one counter-argument, supplying your opponent 
with still another brick for his defense wall.

Arguing presumes that we can use force of will to change minds - and souls. 
Yet, force begets couterforce. And what would be the result of winning an 
argument, anyway? Probably another wisenheimer.

There is a better way.

The path forward, it seems, is to connect, to engage and to serve. To build trust. 
To earn credibility by living what you teach. Then, inviting others to join you in your journey. 

However, that seldom happens overnight. It takes time and commitment and humility.

And honest concern for the other person.

Giving birth to a disciple demands a heart decision. 

How can you help someone to reach that point?
