Everyday you can choose your attitude.

For instance, the attitude of being ready. Ready to engage to the 
benefit of others.

- Ready to help
- Ready to find a solution
- Ready to change things to the better
- Ready to give hope
- Ready to trust

Nothing of all that falls natural for anyone of us. Yet, we can intentionally work on it. Day by day, week after week. Sooner or later, this attitude will become so much a part of you that you don’t need to remind yourself. At that point, it’s no big deal anymore. Not for you.

Yet, others get encouraged. 

And you get satisfied.
