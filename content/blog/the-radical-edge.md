Growing movements often move along a radical edge.

Their followers have faith and are strongly committed to their purpose. They gladly step out of their comfort zone, take great risks, and work day and night. They pay the price in order to serve that purpose.

The first followers of Jesus became such a movement. And today they still are, that is, as long as they still are a Jesus movement.

Unfortunately, large chunks of this movement became and still become watered-down over time. Thinking they have been too radical, too zealous, too different from the world around them, they may feel the need to become more “normal” or ”decent”, more like everybody else. Trying to fit in.

This results in the loss of passion and purpose. And in the loss of life.
After that, all that remains is a shadow — an organizational frame with its positions, mechanisms and rituals, yet, without the faith and the spiritual power that made them grow in the beginning. The empty machinery goes on for a while and may survive several generations. However, its life is constantly declining and finally coming to an end.

As followers of Jesus, this is not meant to be our destiny. 

Today, Jesus is more present in this world than ever before in history, and he constantly moves on, pouring out his life to ever more people, creating ever more ways to serve his purpose - moving along the radical edge.

Seeking and saving the lost.

This is where you and I belong.
