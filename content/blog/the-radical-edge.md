Growing spiritual movements often have a radical edge.

Their followers are filled with a vision and strongly committed to their mission. They gladly step out of 
their comfort zone, take great risks, are willing to sacrifice, and work day and night, 
paying the price in order to fulfill that mission.

The first followers of Jesus became such a movement. And today they still are, that is, wherever they 
genuinely follow Jesus.

Unfortunately, large chunks of this movement became and still become watered-down over time. Thinking 
they have been too radical, too zealous, too different from the world around them, they may feel the 
need to become more “normal”, regarded ”decent”, more like everybody else. Trying to fit in, playing it safe. 

Getting established. 

This results in the loss of passion and mission. And the loss of life. 

Now, all that remains is a skeleton — an institutional framework with its positions, procedures, rituals 
and traditions, yet, without the faith and the spiritual power that once made them grow and change the world. 
The  machinery still runs idle for a while and may survive several generations. However, its life is 
constantly declining and finally coming to an end, resulting in total fossilisation.

Followers of Jesus have no obligation to follow such a development, even less to contribute to it. 

Today, Jesus is more present and active in this world than ever before since the early days, and by his Spirit 
he constantly moves on, pouring out his life to ever more people, creating ever more ways to fulfilll his 
mission - to seek and save the lost.

With a radical edge.

Through people like you and me.
