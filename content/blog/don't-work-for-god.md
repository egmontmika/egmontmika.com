Don’t work FOR the Lord! Work WITH him!

Why are there so many discouraged and burned-out pastors? Why do so many leave the ministry? Didn’t Jesus say that his burden would be light?

Maybe ministry has become too heavy, because too much has been added by man. Too much of human ambitions and desires to influence and accomplish and control. And get honoured.

Jesus simply expects us to follow him and make disciples. Then, naturally, we take care of each other as a family.

He isn’t pushing, but leading. He is always active and lets us join in.

You can do as little or as much as you are able to or have faith for or think that you can afford. In this way, your burden is self-regulating. It never grows beyond your ability and your faith. Still, it can grow, slowly enough to enable you to grow along with it.

I don’t think we need to make up a great vision or strategy or plan, just because this is what every “successful” church seems to have and what all the leadership books tell us.

Neither do we need to follow any specific method. And we don’t need to prove anything to anyone, neither to ourselves. The Lord alone defines success and he alone is worthy to receive the honour for it.

So don’t worry. Don’t worry about your ministry or the expectations around you. Don’t submit to them. Rather step out - mentally, emotionally, spiritually and, if necessary, physically.

Keep ministry simple and let the Lord lead. Follow him step by step and develop yourself, your group and your work along with what he is doing and letting you do at your pace.

After all, he is the leader, nothing less, and we are his followers, nothing more. He knows what he is doing and will not allow any of his workers to fail or get burned out.

Therefore, don’t try to do anything for him. Instead, find out what he is doing and work together with him!
