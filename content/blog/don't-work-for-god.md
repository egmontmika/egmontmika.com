Don’t work FOR the Lord! Work WITH him!

Why are there so many discouraged and burned-out pastors? Why do so many leave the ministry? Didn’t Jesus say that his burden would be light?

Maybe ministry has become too heavy, because too much has been added by man. Too much of human ambitions and desires to influence and accomplish and control. Too much of duties, worries and fear.

Jesus simply expects us to follow him and make disciples. Then, naturally, we take care of each other as a family.

He isn’t pushing, but leading.

You can do as little or as much as you are able to, or have faith for, or think that you can afford. In this way, your burden is self-regulating. It never grows beyond your ability and your faith. Still, it can grow, slowly enough to enable you to grow along with it.

I don’t think we need to make up a great vision or strategy or plan, just because this is what all the leadership books tell us and what every great church seems to have. It's just a guessing anyway. And a burden. Or even a curse.

And we don’t need to prove our spirituality or ability as a leader to anyone, neither to ourselves. The Lord leads by his Spirit and defines what success is, and he alone is to be honoured.

So, don’t worry.

Don’t worry about "your ministry". It's not yours anyway, but Jesus'. And don't submit to wrong expectations from others. Instead, find out what the Lord has prepared for you.

Then, join in WITH him!
