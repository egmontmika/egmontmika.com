It’s easy to imagine that the only way to start a church is by:

- Renting an auditorium,
- Hiring a worship team,
- Gathering a crowd. 

Of course, this isn’t true.

You don’t need all of this, not even money. You can start a church right where 
you live, work, study or spend your spare time by just making one disciple of Jesus. 
One at a time. And then another one, and another. 

And you teach these people to do the same.

Your home base is your kitchen table. This is where you gather, share your meals, 
pray your prayers, mentor and empower your people. 

This is where everythings starts.

Your area of operation is the city, the streets and squares, the parks, shopping centers, 
restaurants and cafés, the gyms and clubs… any place you can meet people.

Soon, there will be a fellowship of disciples.

That’s a church.

It may seem easier, faster and more remarkable to rent an auditorium, hire a worship team and make enough 
noise to attract a crowd. Then call it a church.

The question is, What would Jesus call it?
