Are you looking for a thrill?

You might have been thrilled when you experienced the Lord for the first time, or when you got baptized in the Spirit and started speaking in tongues, or when you for the first time prayed for someone and this person actually got healed on the spot. Or maybe when you sensed the Lord’s presence during a special worship service…

But now the thrill is gone.

Of course it is. According to human nature, emotional kicks are temporary, they are over soon.

Repeating the same thing over and over again just isn’t that much of a thrill. You may love your work, but it probably doesn’t give you a kick every time you open the door to your office. Not like the day you did it for the first time.

So, if you are looking for excitement, you will have to find a new experience. And after that another one, and  then still another, again and again. And every time you'll get satisfied just for a little while.

Is this why some married people are looking for a new partner when they realize their first excitement is gone?

The life of a disciple of Jesus isn’t to chase excitements, not even spiritual ones.

Rather, it’s to faithfully continue the journey you set out on a while ago. To see the needs around you with open eyes, to listen to the Lord and do whatever is required. To make the necessary changes in your own life and to lead others along that same path.

It's a long time commitment, day after day.

Doing something that matters.

Making a difference. Changing the world in small persistent steps to the better.

Exciting is fine, yet, mattering is way more important.

And, in the long run, even more exciting.
