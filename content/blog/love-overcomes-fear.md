Love and fear don't match.

One primary characteristic of virtually all religious systems around the world is fear: 
fear of judgment, fear of curses, fear of hell, fear of punishment, fear of failing - communicated and
held up by some sort of religious authority or system.

Sadly, this also can be found within Christianity.

In contrast, read the following:

- "There is no fear in love. But perfect love drives out fear, because fear has to do 
with punishment. The one who fears is not made perfect in love." (1 John 4:18 NIV)

- "Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love." (1 John 4:8 NIV)â€¨

- "So do not fear, for I am with you; do not be dismayed, for I am your God. I will 
strengthen you and help you; I will uphold you with my righteous right hand." 
(Isaiah 41:10 NIV)

The Spirit of Jesus and the spirit of fear are opposed to each other. 
The Spirit of Jesus produces love that overcomes fear. 

Now, here is the challenge: 

In case that fear, guilt or shame characterise your relationship to God, don't stay there, 
but follow the one who truely sets you free.
