Are you ready to make a disciple? 

And in case your answer is "no", what would you need in order to become ready?

Jesus trained his disciples for three and a half years. Then he sent them out. Where they fully educated then? - No. Did they master the skills of an evangelist or preacher or teacher? - No. 

In fact, they hardly had faith to do the job, nor the skill or the understanding. 

Still Jesus sent them out. 

And we know from the book of Acts that what ever they were lacking, the Holy Spirit could provide at the right time when they needed it. 

What they had learnt and seen was not all they could have learned if they had been with Jesus for another decade. But it was good enough. What the Spirit needed in order to accomplish anything through these people was not more education but their willingness.

Let's face it! Believing that more sermons will make you a better disciple maker is an illusion. In fact, it can be counterproductive. The more you listen, the less you may be willing to go out. 

Sermons may give you the feeling of being on the right track. Or even better, to be right up front in what God is doing in our time. In reality, they may keep you from actually stepping out and doing what these sermons are supposed to equip you for.

They may give you some good spiritual entertainment, maybe a better one than much of the entertainment available out there.

Yet, for you itâ€™s just that. Entertainment.
