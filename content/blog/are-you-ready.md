Are you ready to make a disciple? 

What would you need in order to be ready?

Jesus trained his disciples for three and a half years. Then he sent them out. 

Where they fully educated then? - No. 

Did they master the skills of an evangelist or preacher or teacher? - No. 

In fact, they hardly had faith to do the job, even less the skill or the understanding. 

Still Jesus sent them out. 

And we know that what ever they were lacking the Holy Spirit could provide at the right time when they needed it. 

What they had learnt and seen was not all they could have learned if they had been with Jesus for another decade. But it was good enough. What the Spirit needed in order to accomplish anything through these people was not more education but their willingness.

Believing that listening to more sermons will make you a better disciple maker is an illusion. In fact, listening to more sermons can be counter productive. The more you listen the less you may be willing to go out. 

Listening to ever more sermons may give you the feeling of being on the right track. Or even more, to be right up front in what God is doing in our time. In reality, it may keep you from actually stepping out and doing what the sermons are supposed to equip you for.

The very thing that is supposed to equip your for becoming fruitful disguises itself as something that keeps you where you are. It may give you some good spiritual entertainment, maybe better than much of the entertainment available out there.

Yet, itâ€™s just that, entertainment.
