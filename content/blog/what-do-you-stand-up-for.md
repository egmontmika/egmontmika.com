Have you ever felt like this? 

You know exactly what would be right in a given situation. What could be done in order to change that situation to the better. And you also know that you are the one who could make it happen.

Yet, you hesitate.

What is it that keeps you from doing it? 

Is it convenience? Or complacency?  

Or is it fear? 

The fear of getting opposed, rejected, intimidated. The fear of failure and shame. Or the fear of negative consequences.

When we pursue our purpose, we overcome. 

When our purpose is bigger than ourselves, something higher than our personal striving for comfort, security and acceptance, then convenience and fear become irrelevant. You care and take courage. 

You speak up - stand up - take action.

Jesus gave you that purpose.
