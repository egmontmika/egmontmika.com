You know exactly what to do now. 

What would be the right. What would turn the situation to the better. And you that you could make it happen.

Yet, you hesitate.

Why do you back off? 

Is it because of convenience? Or complacency? Or fear? 

The fear of getting opposed, rejected, intimidated. The fear of failure? Of shame? Or the fear of negative consequences.

When we pursue our purpose, we overcome. 

When our purpose is bigger than ourselves, something higher than our personal striving for comfort, security and acceptance, then convenience and fear become irrelevant. We grow beyond the resistance and get envolved. We care enough to pay the price.

And take courage. 

We speak up, stand up, and take action.

Martin Luther King Jr. had such a purpose. Jesus had. Paul had.

You have.
