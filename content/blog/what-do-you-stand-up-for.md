You know exactly what would be the right thing to do now. To change a situation to the better. To help, encourage, do good.

Yet, you hesitate.

Why do you back off? 

Is it because of convenience? Or complacency? Or doubt? 

Or because of the fear of being taken advantage of? Or because of the risks? The fear of failure? Would the price be too high?

How can we overcome our resistance?

It's when we pursue a purpose. When our purpose is greater than ourselves, something higher and stronger than our personal pursuit of comfort, security and acceptance. Then, obstacles won't scare us.  Then, obstacles make us grow and overcome initial resistance. We take courage and get involved. 

We care enough to pay the price.

We speak up, stand up, and take action. 

Do good.

Jesus had such a purpose. Paul of Tarsus had. Martin Luther King Jr. had.

You have.
