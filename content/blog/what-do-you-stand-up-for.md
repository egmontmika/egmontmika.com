You know exactly what would be right. 

You know what needs to be done in order to turn the situation. And you could do it.

Yet, you hesitate.

Why do you back off? 

Is it because of convenience? Or complacency? Or fear? 

The fear of getting opposed, rejected, intimidated? The fear of failure? Of shame? Or of having to face the negative consequences?

How can we overcome that resistance?

It's when we pursue our purpose. When our purpose is greater than ourselves, something higher and stronger than our personal pursuit of comfort, security and acceptance. Then, convenience and fear become irrelevant. Then, we grow beyond our resistance. We take courage and get envolved. 

We care enough to pay the price.

We speak up, stand up, and take action.

Jesus had such a purpose. Paul of Tarsus had. Martin Luther King Jr. had.

You have.
