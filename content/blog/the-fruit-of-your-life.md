All we have is each other.

It's all we’ve ever had of real value, and all we’re ever going to get. That's it. Neither less, nor more.

It’s neither your career nor your money, nor your possessions, power, image or self-esteem. 
Nor your consumption. And it’s not your doctrines.

Ultimately, people are all that matters and your relationships all that counts. They are the substance of your 
efforts and your time investments, worth everything.

The fruit of your life.

It’s up to you how much fruit there is and will be. It all depends on how you engage with people 
and on the qualities you use when building your relationships. 

And on the outcome of your actions. Are they uplifting or destructive? Life-reinforcing 
or life-weakening? Are you a giver or a taker?

It all depends on how you treat people - today.
