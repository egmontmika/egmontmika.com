All we have is each other.

It's all we’ve ever had of real value, and all we’re ever going to get. Neither less, nor more.

It’s neither your career nor your possessions, power, image or self-esteem. Neither your consumption nor 
sparetime activities, nor your opinions and ideas. And it’s not your doctrines.

Ultimately, people are all that matters, and your relationships all that counts. They are the substance of your 
efforts and your time investments, worth everything.

The fruit of your life.

It’s up to you how much fruit there is and will be. 

It all depends on how you engage with people and on the qualities you build into your relationships. 
Also, on the outcome of your interactions. 

Are they uplifting or destructive? Reinforcing life or weakening life? Are you a giver or a taker?

It's up to you.
