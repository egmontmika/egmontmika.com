Have you ever tried to change someone’s habit with the help of arguments?

Or have you tried to convince yourself with arguments and then change an old habit? Like introducing a new diet or a daily workout or a regular time for study and prayer, or making it a habit to always be on time? Or...?

Did it work out for you? Not only for a few times, but continuously? And in case it did, did you succeed because of the arguments?

My experience is that whenever I managed to establish a new habit, I was in a crisis, or desperate enough or just fed up with the status quo. Or filled with a vision. I really wanted a change, no matter what the reasoning, and long before I knew all the arguments.

We probably change a habit on other grounds than logical thinking. Yet, once the decision is made, we welcome arguments to back it up with, and we use these arguments whenever we feel a need to motivate or defend the decision.

Real change is made on a much deeper, emotional or spiritual level. It’s the level where we manage things like courage and fear, trust and distrust, faith and doubt.

It seems to me like most of us, most of the time are not really ready for a change. Although we may not be quite happy about a certain habit, we still prefer the status quo. It just feels safer or easier; at least we know what we got and we hope that it will not get worse.

While listening to all the good arguments and nodding our heads in agreement, our inside may scream a roaring NO. While our intellect agrees, our inside will not allow the change.

This is the situation every preacher is facing. Probably, most of his or her listeners are not really willing to change. And in order to not offend anyone with a clear ”no”, we escape into pretending.  However, true preaching aims at change; changed attitudes, decisions and actions - including changed habits.

Listening without acting leads into ritualized, passive behavior. And listening to still more leads into even deeper passivity. It immunizes against the message, makes you favor the status quo and end up in religion.

Then, listening to sermons seems counterproductive. It makes you feel spiritual without becoming more spiritual.

We fool ourselves when we think of having accomplished anything by just agreeing. On the other hand, good arguments can back up a decision and make it really strong.

Still, more basic than all the arguments is the question, whether you are desperate enough, and whether you have enough courage, trust and faith in order to overcome complacency, doubt and fear?

Are you ready?
