In the beginning, God created…

This is how the probably most significant story of mankind begins. This story has been told for thousands of years and it still is passed on from generation to generation. 

It’s the story of stories.

This story tells us where we come from and what our purpose is, and it connects us humans in a global perspective, across the borders of races, nations, and generations. 

It’s the story that tells us who we are.

In order to fully unfold its beauty and its power, it best is told orally. Just knowing about it or being able to state its content does not give you the full experience. Writing it down or reading it word by word is a lot better, but still not quite the same as listen to it as it is told orally. 

In order to experience the power of the story, you may have to catch its unwritten values, beliefs, convictions, experiences… 

You will have to catch its spirit.

Therefore, nothing matches up to listening to someone who not only knows the story by heart but loves it and has incorporated it into his own convictions and beliefs. Someone who has aligned with its spirit. 

Then, the story truly becomes alive. 

Then, this story can break down the barriers, the self-imposed differences we have given ourselves, and strengthen bonds and build trust between people, unlike any other force. 

It enables us to transcend beyond our differences, peering into a more fundamental realm of our existence, one more intrinsic to our nature than many of our rationalistic attempts to understand what human life is all about.

Then, inspiration takes place.
