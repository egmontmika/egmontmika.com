In the beginning, God created…

This is how the probably most significant story of mankind begins. This story has been told for thousands of years and it still is passed on from generation to generation.

It’s the story of stories.

This story tells us where we come from and what our purpose is, and it connects us humans globally, across the borders of races, nations, and generations.

It’s the story that tells us who we are.

In order to fully unfold its beauty and its power, it best is told orally. Just knowing about it or being able to state its content does not give you the full experience. Writing it down or reading it word by word is much better, but still not quite the same as listening to it when being told orally.

In order to fully experience its power, you may want to catch even its unwritten values, beliefs, convictions, experiences…

You may want to catch its spirit.

Therefore, nothing matches up to listening to someone who tells the story orally and with conviction. Who not only knows it by heart but loves it and has incorporated it into his beliefs. Someone who has aligned with its spirit.

Then, the story truly becomes alive.

Then, this story enables us to transcend beyond our self-imposed differences, peering into a more fundamental realm of our existence, one more intrinsic to our nature than many of our rationalistic attempts to understand what human life is all about. 

When the power of this story is unleashed, it encourages us to strengthen bonds and build mutual trust.

And work for a common future.
