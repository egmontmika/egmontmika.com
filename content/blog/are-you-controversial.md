It's no sin to be controversial.

Anyone standing up for what is right will meet opposition. The higher your position, the worse it can get. The stronger the rejection. The more dangerous the consequences.

The higher your purpose, the higher the cost.

Jesus was controversial. And he paid the price for what he stood up.

As his follower, you hardly get away without it.
