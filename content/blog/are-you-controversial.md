It isn’t a bad thing to be controversial. And it’s absolutely no sin.

Anyone who stands up for what is right will meet opposition. The higher your position, the worse it can get. The stronger the rejection. The more disastrous the possible consequences.

The higher your purpose, the higher the cost.

With this in mind, it seems an easier way to adapt, to conform, to be nice, trying to please as many as possible. Follow the public opinion, stay politically correct and socially accepted.

Sadly, this is where many a spiritual movement finally ended. After an initial period of radical commitment, many times ridiculed, despised or hated, the movement slowly adapted and finally became well respected. This has been the weakness of mainstream Christianity throughout the centuries. And it still is.

“When the salt loses its saltiness it’s not good for anything.”

Not so Jesus. Jesus was controversial. And he still is.

He never bowed under the pressure from his surroundings. Rather than calming down and taking it safe, he kept challenging his opponents to the uttermost.

He was able to stand up against the storm because he was willing to pay the price.

And he finally did.

As his follower, be prepared for being controversial, as well. In fact, being controversial for a higher cause can be a very good thing. Meeting opposition can clarify your purpose, sharpen your focus and strengthen your will.

Shows what you go for.

For some of us, being controversial is a necessity.
