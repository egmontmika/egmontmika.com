It’s no sin to be controversial.

Anyone standing up for what is right will meet opposition. The higher your position, the worse it can get. The stronger the rejection. The more dangerous the consequences.

The higher your purpose, the higher the cost.

It seems an easier way to adapt, to conform, to be nice, trying to please as many as possible. Follow the public opinion, being politically correct, getting socially accepted. 

Sadly, this is where many a church movement finally ended. This is the weakness of mainstream Christianity throughout the centuries. And it still is.

"When the salt loses its saltiness it’s not good for anything."

Jesus was controversial. 

He never bowed under the pressure from his surroundings. Rather than calming down and taking it safe, he kept challenging his opponents to the uttermost.

He was able to stand up against the storm because he was willing to pay the price.

And he did.

As his follower, be prepared for meeting rejection.

It’s no sin to be controversial.
