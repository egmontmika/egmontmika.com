A car on its roof doesn’t make sense.

No matter how hard you push the pedal, how much noise 
the engine makes and how fast its wheels spin round, 
this car won’t take you anywhere.

To make sense, a car just has to stand on its four wheels. 

Let’s apply that to the church. 

A church standing on its feet would look like this:

1. Jesus
2. Mission
3. Church

Here is the explanation: 

*Jesus*

Jesus was there from the beginning. He is the Lord and originater. His name is above all other names. Without him, neither mission nor church would exist. Therefore, Jesus is number 1. 

*Mission*

The mission is Jesus’ mission. It was his from the beginning and it still is. Without hime, there would be no mission. Therefore, Mission is number 2.

*Church* 

After his resurrection, Jesus passed his mission on to the people who followed him. That is, to the church. The church is the result of his mission and today, the church is the communicator and multiplyer of that result. The church comes after both Jesus and his mission. Therefore, Church is number 3.

An upside-down order would look like this:

1. Church
2. Mission
3. Jesus

And the explanation: 

*Church*

The Church with its name and organisation is number one. The Church has a 
missiology and a theology. That is, the Church defines what its mission is and who 
its Jesus is. Therefore, the Church would be number 1. 

*Mission*

The mission is the mission of the church. Without church there would be no mission. 
And without church we wouldn’t know what that mission is. Therefore, Mission follows as number 2. 

*Jesus*

Jesus is the Jesus of the church. The church defines who he is and in what way he still is 
relevant. He is the outcome of the church's mission. Therefore, Jesus would be number 3.

Two models - two ways of looking at Jesus and the church. Which are the consequences 
of the first? And of the second?

Which model is practiced in your church?

And which is *yours*?
