Discipleship is a choice.

You don’t just slide into being a disciple of Jesus by accident. Or wake up one morning and find yourself having arrived there.

It always requires a conscious decision on your behalf - your own personal decision.

Neither your father or mother, nor your buddies can decide that for you. Nobody else can, but you. And it’s not a matter of background, tradition, culture, age, education, talent or opinion…

It’s a matter of trust. Trust in God.

Anyone can make that decision.  Yet, it isn’t easy for anyone. You will always meet resistance. The way resistance comes can be different from person to person and it can vary in strength, but for sure, it will come..

It can come from the outside, from your family, your relatives, your buddies… as a slight sneering comment or a solid death threat, or anything in between.

It also can come from the inside, from your own thinking, your distrust and fear, or your pride and self-righteousness. Or your doubts. Or your complacency… The resistance has many faces and many expressions.

When facing the choice, it always seems easier to choose the other option, that is, not to follow Jesus. Or to postpone the decision. Or to pretend.

However, no matter how strong the resistance, you’ll always find people ready for a quality decision to follow Jesus, even in the face of persecution - truly a great decision.

It takes courage.

And trust!
