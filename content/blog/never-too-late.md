The best time to plant a tree was twenty years ago, it is said.
Yet, the second best time is now. 

It’s never too late to plant a tree.

No matter how old you are, today you can do it. Today, you can start an education, learning a language, changeing a habit or a project...

Today, you can make an investment in the future. It’s never too late.

Our lives are far more significant than we tend to think at the moment. Every single one of us is the center of a sphere of influence. And we are reaching out, not only to the people around us during our own life time, but also to those who come after us.

They may not always know who started your project, yet, they enjoy its outcome. And they may not know who was the planter, yet they enjoy your tree and its fruit. 

Today you can invest in the future.

It's never too late.
