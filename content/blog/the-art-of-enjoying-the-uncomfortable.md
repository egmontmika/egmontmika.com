Progress and comfort don’t match.

While not everything that is uncomfortable automatically will give you progress, there will always be a certain amount of inconvenience going along with it.

Performance spikes when we’re doing something out of our norm.

Throughout Scripture, we find that following God’s call and at the same time striving for a comfortable life seem to contradict each other. Typically, responding to a call is connected with the requirement of stepping out and leaving. Leaving your family and friends, your familiar environment, and your securities. Changing your preferences and habits.

The act of stepping outside our bubble is not only vital to our success, but also to our well being and our ability to grow as individuals. 

It's vital to our spiritual development.

Jesus never promised his disciples a comfortable life, yet, he expected them to be ”fruitful”.  For those who wanted to follow him, he pointed out what they could expect: inconveniences, uncertainty, hatred, and persecution.

Is this too hard?

No, it isn’t. Not for those who have made up their minds. They are looking forward to their success and consider it worthwhile all the trouble. They know that it makes them achieve more than they ever dreamed possible.

They have learned to take advantage of the uncomfortable and progress.

And to enjoy it.

This is the art of enjoying the uncomfortable.
