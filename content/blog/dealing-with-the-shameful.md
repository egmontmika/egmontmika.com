There are things I absolutely don’t want to talk about.

Like when I made a fool of myself. Or when I offended someone, gave a stupid or arrogant or childish response, yelled and screamed,  broke my promise, or just followed a sinful habit…

I just don’t feel like talking about the things I am ashamed of. Why should I?

Why should I expose myself and admit my failure? Why bother others with my private stuff?

The problem is that others have seen it, and that’s embarrassing. Or in case nobody did, at least I know about it and feel ashamed. That’s painful enough. And of course, the Lord knows it…

Is there a way out?

Yes, there is. I’ll have to talk about it.

Admitted, not everybody needs to know all my filthy stuff, and probably it wouldn’t be of any public interest, anyway.

However, if this thing is still bothering me, I need to talk about it.

Take a deep breath and talk to someone I trust. And contact the person I offended or let down or betrayed, not in order to explain, but to admit, regret and apologize. Then, give myself a new start.

That can completely change my situation. It’s like opening a window and letting fresh air flood into my room.

Are you in that situation?

Then, talk about it. It isn’t always easy. Yet, it’s worth it.
