There are certain things I absolutely don’t feel happy to talk about.

Like telling another person how I made a fool of myself, or the number of times I reacted immaturely or arrogantly. Nor do I want to speak about the time I yelled and screamed and just couldn’t control my anger. But why should I?

Why should I expose myself and admit my failures? Why bother others with my private stuff?

The problem is that others have seen it, and that’s embarrassing enough. Or in case nobody did, at least I know about it and feel ashamed. And of course, the Lord knows it…

Is there a way out?

Yes, there is. I’ll have to talk about it.

Admitted, not everybody needs to know all my filth, and probably it wouldn’t be of any public interest, anyway.

However, if this thing is still bothering me, I need to talk about it.

I need to take a deep breath and talk to someone I trust. And contact the person I offended or let down or betrayed, not in order to explain, but to admit, regret and apologize. Then, give myself a new start.

This can completely change my situation. It’s like opening a window and letting fresh air flood into my room.

Are you in that situation?

Then, may I suggest that you talk about it. It isn’t always easy.

Yet, it’s worth it.
