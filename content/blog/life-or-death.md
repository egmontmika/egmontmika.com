You can’t save the whole world. 

However, there is at least one for whom you can make all the difference.

The story goes about a man, who on his morning walk along the beach watched a boy picking up starfishes and throwing them into the water. When asked what he was doing the boy replied, I’m saving starfishes. If they stay on the beach, they will die.

By looking at the length of the beach and imagining the thousands of starfishes that might be there the man shook his head and said, You will not be able to save them all. Maybe not, the boy replied, and by picking up another starfish and throwing it back into the water he continued, For this one, it makes all the difference.

As a follower of Jesus, you may not be able to save the whole world. However, to those you reach, it can makes all the difference.

The difference between life and death.
