Everybody likes to receive applause.

Applause is encouraging, uplifting, satisfying, flattering...  If you ask a professional performer, he will tell you that for him applause is far more than just an act of courtesy or a kind gesture. For him, it is part of his reward, many times more worth than his wages. To him, applause is a necessity. This is what he is labouring and living for.

However, we must realise that the crowd is unreliable, and their applause is only momentary. The crowd has a constant appetite for more, and they quickly forget about your past achievements. They happily applaud you as long as you continue to meet their expectations and as long as they can celebrate you as their hero. Yet, the day will come when you will disappoint them, and then you are out. Who would care less, then?

Even Jesus received applause from those around him.

However, he was never looking for it, he never trusted it, nor did his life depend on it. He knew that he couldn’t rely on the crowd. Instead, he totally focused on pleasing his Father and on working out his mission. In doing so, he found joy and fulfilment. This is one of the things he passed on to his disciples; he wanted them to follow him even in this respect.

It’s nice to receive applause from people. Yet in the long run, the Father’s applause is the only applause worth living for.
