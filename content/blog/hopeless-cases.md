Why do some people never learn? 

Who keep their toothpaste open, leave their dirty cup in the sink, spit their chewing gum just anywhere, never pick up litter, or take out the trash. 

Do they not know better? In this case, the solution would be to inform them that this behavior is not acceptable and show them how to do it.

However, not knowing rarely is the reason. You may call it an attitude. These people just donâ€™t care. They don't care for what you care. They have other values and preferences. 

So, how can you change someone's preferences? 

Some of us would say, It's impossible, and call it a hopeless case. And we may be right if expecting the shift to happen on the spot. Pointing a finger, though, seldom changes someone's attitude or preferences; at best you will get a hypocrite. 

If we want to see real change, we need to address a deeper level of consciousness. We will have to engage and teach and communicate in a way that shares our emotions, insights, values, and beliefs.

Jesus wouldn't call anyone a hopeless case, far less start an argument on that level. Instead, he would aim at changing people from the inside. And for a higher purpose than just raising their outward behavior.

He would touch their heart.
