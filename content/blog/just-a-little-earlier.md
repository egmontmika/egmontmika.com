To certain people, it seems all right to show up "a little late". As a habit.

Nobody will take notice anyway, it seems. And others will be late as well, they think.

To them, coming late is all right, as long as they donâ€™t miss the highlights and as long as they get what they are expecting. And fulfill their social duty to show up.

Why invest more time than necessary?

Others may want to come a little earlier. Be there before the program starts. Offering a little extra time. Just to be prepared. Or to encourage the host. Or to make themselves available. Like being able to lend a helping hand for the last preparations.

Or to chat with another early comer. Encourage someone who came with a need, with the desire to meet someone who would listen.

Coming a little earlier gives you time to connect. Time to build a relationship. Time to care.

It's precious time!

You may not want to miss it.
