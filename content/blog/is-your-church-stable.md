One significant characteristic of virtually all human organizations is the pursuit of stability.

The same with churches and home groups.

Stability gives us a sense of security and peace. And success. The turbulent times of initial struggles is over and we finally arrived at a place where we can lean back and enjoy our accomplishments. Now, we are established and we know how to run this church.

We are ”maturer”, now.

From now on, all we have to do is to protect what we have got. Protect it against possible agitators and trouble-makers. Protect it against these far too creative people and their ideas. Protect it against the ignorance and naivety of newcomers.

We really don’t want to make the same mistakes over and over again. And we don’t want to make any new mistakes, either. Why taking a risk, when we finally got everything so well settled?

This is the point when we get stuck in our own ways of doing things, when we give up to engage, to thrive and to change.

This is when we close our doors.

The decline has begun and it’s the beginning of the end. For a while we still enjoy the cosiness and familiarity of a well-established, stable community and the self-affirmation that comes along with it. ”We are good people and not like others…”

Then comes the hubris. And the boredom.

Soon, the average age of our group is 70 and we don’t know what to do about it.

The solution would be to start all over again. To take risks, to stretch our possibilities, to accept challenges, to explore the unknown, to give up security…

To humble ourselves and engage with people. And get messy.

By starting all over again we may loose the stability of our organization, the cosiness and familiarity of our fellowship, our comfort and complacency and respectability…

We may loose it all - but win some souls.

How exciting!
