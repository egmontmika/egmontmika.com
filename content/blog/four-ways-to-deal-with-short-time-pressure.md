Four Ways to Deal with Short-Time Pressure

Making this phone call, preparing the dinner, picking up the kids, cleaning the house, buying a birthday present, fixing the bike, getting a haircut, washing the clothes, reading the manual, answering those emails… The list seems endless.

How do you deal with short-time pressure?

The question is, what is important and urgent and what not. Not everything important is urgent. And not everything urgent also is important. And some things that claim to be both are neither one.

So let’s have a look at the four options and find out how to deal with them, one by one.

Urgent and important Do these things right away or as soon as possible.

Important, but not urgent Schedule a time when you want to do this or reserve a fixed time every day, week or month. Then follow that schedule. 
Urgent, but not important. - Two options. a. Let someone else do it.  b. Don’t spoil your precious recreation or family time or your best working hours with that. Maybe you can do it while communiting or sitting in a waiting room or watching the news. Or when you are too tired for more important things.

Not urgent and not important. - Two options. a. Never do it. And never let your mind get occupied with it. Don’t let junkmail lie around, but trash it right away. b. Write it on a seperate to-do-list for minor important things and keep it there. Some matters settle themselves and can be deleted after a while. Or do it when it becomes urgent.

In order to make this work, you may want to make a deal with yourself and decide about your priorities. You can’t do everything at all times. Ultimately, what is your purpose and your mission? What do you want to accomplish or improve or maximise. Why are you into this career? Who do you want to serve? 

Once you know your priorities, stay consistant and let them guide you. Then, confirm or renew your decision from time to time when not under pressure. 

This, if anything, is important.
