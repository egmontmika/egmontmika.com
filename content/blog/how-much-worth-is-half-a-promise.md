If you are hungry, half a hamburger is better than nothing.

If you need  to finance a project, raising only half of the money is better than no money at all.
If you’re expecting a thousand people to read your article and only five hundred actually read it, this is still better than none.

Many times, half is better than nothing. But not always. What about half a promise?

- If you ask a baby sitter to come ove…
- If you invite friends for a dinner…
- If you need a partner for your project…
- If you want to marry…

…and the answer never gets beyond a ”maybe”, I would call this giving half a promise.

Half a promise can be even worse than no promise.

With a ”no”, you still had the choice of asking someone else, but with a ”maybe” you are stuck. You don’t get anywhere, and things can get even worse. Like, when "promising" a beach vacation to your family, or "agreeing" to engage in a project, or "promising" a life-long marriage - and never getting beyond a "maybe"...

In these cases, half a promise can end in a sheer disaster for you and for whoever partners with you.

The same is true for our decision to follow Jesus. He expects us to give him a clear ”yes” or ”no”, not a ”maybe”.

And pretending would be even worse than that.

It’s good for you and me to make up our minds and know what we want and what we don’t want to engage in. And it’s a blessing for everyone around us when we are able give a clear ”yes” or ”no”.

If you can’t give a wholehearted promise, it’s probably better not to give any.
