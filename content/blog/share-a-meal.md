*Hospitality is an expression of God’s character.*

God is welcoming, generous, nourishing, lavish, joyful… He is hospital. And this is what we communicate.

It’s as easy as sharing a meal with a friend, a collegue, a neighbor, or a stranger. Or why not a beggar! God is indiscriminate. He is including.

Your meal doesn’t have to be fancy. Don’t let it be exclusive; there is no need to impress. Just share what you have, it may be abundant or little, a three-course dinner or a glas of water. Or a piece of chocolate or a banana. Just act according to the situation.

It’s not so much about the food itsself, but your attitude. It’s about what people sense when they are together with you.

*An expression of grace.*

You give them an experience of being accepted, respected, appreciated and honored. A sense of belonging without having to qualify or defend themselves.

It breaks the power of fear and alienation and prejudice.

*An expression of freedom.*

You create an environment free of control or accusations. Devoid of the need to impress or pretend. Allowing people to be who they are. Sharing your love. Creating community.

Creating an expression of how God is.
