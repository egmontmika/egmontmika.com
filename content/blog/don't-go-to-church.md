From the beginning, church wasn't meant to be a program or an event. Not a worship service. Far less a building an organisation or a denomination. 

What is it, then?

It’s a family, a movement, a divine fellowship. It’s a calling.  And a mission. 

It’s what we are birthed into as followers of Jesus, redeemed through Jesus, reconciled with our Father in heaven. 

By his grace.

Molong Nacua, a Jesus follower from the Filipines, put it this way:
”Church is where Christ lives, not the place where we meet. It is Christ-empowered people, a kingdom of priests for the purpose of winning against the works of the devil and establishing God's Kingdom."

It’s not so much about what we do, but who we are. In Christ. No matter where, no matter when. Everywhere, at all times.

We *are* the church.
