Don’t go to church!
From the beginning, church was never meant to be a program or an event, neither a building nor a an organisation or a denomination. Neither a worship service. 
What is it, then?
It’s a family, a movement, a divine fellowship. It’s a calling.  And a mission. It’s what we are birthed into as followers of Jesus, redeemed through Jesus, reconciled with our Father in heaven. 
By his grace.
Molong Nacua, a Jesus follower from the Filipines, put it this way:
”Church is where Christ lives, not the place where we meet. It is Christ-empowered people, a kingdom of priests for the purpose of winning against the works of the devil and establishing God's Kingdom. ”
It’s not about what we do, but who we are. No matter where, no matter when. Everywhere, at all times.
We are the church. You are the church.
Be church!
