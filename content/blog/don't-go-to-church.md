Church isn't a worship service. Nothing you ***go to***.

Neither a program nor an event. Far less a building, an organisation or a denomination. It wasn't that from the beginning, and it still isn't meant to be that today.

What is it, then?

It’s a family, a movement, a divine fellowship. A calling and a mission. 

It’s what we are born into as followers of Jesus, redeemed through him, reconciled with our Father in heaven. 

By his grace.

[Molong Nacua][1], a Jesus follower from the Filipines, put it this way:

>*Church is where Christ lives, not the place where we meet. It is Christ-empowered people, a kingdom of priests for the purpose of winning against the works of the devil and establishing God's Kingdom.*

It’s about who we ***are***. In Christ. Then follow him. Listen and obey. No matter where, no matter when - everywhere, at all times.

Don't ***go to*** church. ***Be*** church.
