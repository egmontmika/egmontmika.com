From the beginning, church wasn't a worship service. 

Not a program or an event you ***go to***. Far less a building, an organisation or a denomination. And it still isn't meant to be that.

What is it, then?

It’s a family, a movement, a divine fellowship. A calling and a mission. 

It’s what we are birthed into as followers of Jesus, redeemed through Jesus, reconciled with our Father in heaven. 

By his grace.

[Molong Nacua][1], a Jesus follower from the Filipines, put it this way:

>*Church is where Christ lives, not the place where we meet. It is Christ-empowered people, a kingdom of priests for the purpose of winning against the works of the devil and establishing God's Kingdom.*

It’s not so much about what we do, but who we are. In Christ. Then listen and obey. No matter where, no matter when. Everywhere, at all times.

***We are*** the church.
