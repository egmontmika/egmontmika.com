Following Jesus rubs off.

As a disciple of Jesus, you influence your environment and you influence people. Discipleship naturally emerges into spiritual leadership.

It’s a different kind of leadership, though. Different from most characteristics that people normally associate with leadership, like power, position, title, status, money, popularity, image, good looks, high IQ, education, or whatever else may impress on people.

It’s an up-side-down leadership based on servanthood, that is, on qualities like humility, honesty and integrity. Like trustworthyness, reliability and morality. And faithfulness and wisdom. And love. And the fear of the Lord.

That is, on discipleship.

You can’t lead another person along a spiritual path that you are not familiar with and without being a disciple yourself. And you can’t lead that person into a living relationship with the Lord without knowing the Lord yourself, being lead by his Spirit and growing as his disciple.

In short, you cannot lead anyone beyond the quality of your own discipleship.

Therefore, are you looking for a spiritual leader? Then, have a closer look at his or her discipleship.

Or, are you attempting to be or become a spiritual leader yourself? Again, have a real close look at the qualities of your discipleship.

Discipleship comes first, true leadership emerges from there.

There is no healthy spiritual leadership without healthy, fruitful discipleship. Yet, true discipleship will always be influential and leave its marks.

It just rubs off.
