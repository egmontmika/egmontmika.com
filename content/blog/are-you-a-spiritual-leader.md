Following Jesus rubs off.

As a disciple of Jesus, you influence your environment and the people around you. Discipleship naturally develops into leadership.

It’s a different kind of leadership, though. Different from what most people probably would expect. Often lacking the most typical characteristics that you usually associate with leadership, like power, position, title, status, money, popularity, image, good looks, high IQ, education, or whatever else impresses on people.

It’s an up-side-down leadership. It's built on servanthood and qualities like humility, honesty and integrity. Like trustworthiness, reliability and morality. And faithfulness and wisdom. And love. And the fear of the Lord.

In short, it's spiritual leadership.

True spiritual leadership is based on discipleship, that is, on being a disciple of Jesus. Discipleship comes first, spiritual leadership emerges from there.

You can’t lead another person along a spiritual path without first having walked that path yourself. And you can’t lead that person into a fruitful disciple relationship without being a disciple yourself. The quality of your leadership depends uttermost on the quality of your discipleship.

You cannot lead a disciple beyond your own level.

Therefore, are you looking for a spiritual leader? Then, have a closer look at his or her discipleship.

Or, are you attempting to be or become a spiritual leader yourself? Again, have a real close look at the quality of your own discipleship. Start improving there and never quit working on it.

As a spiritual leader you can't but be a disciple yourself. And as a disciple you will always influence others and leave marks in their lives.

If this applies to you, you probably are on your way to become - or already are - a spiritual leader.
