Paris, November 13th, 2015!

While having been overwhelmed and horrified by what happened that night, still trying to come to terms with it, I am asking myself:

What will be my response?

For me, it’s not so much a question of whether I got horrified or not, but of what I am going to do with it. What will be the outcome for me personally?

Is the horror going to stay with me, scare me and infect my relationships and my attitude towards the world and the people around me? Towards all Muslims in general as well as my Muslim friends and neighbours?

Will it lead me to a reaction that eventually feeds into a culture of resentment, distrust and fear?

One thing for sure, if I let fear be the result, the attack has reached its goal and the terrorists can praise themselves victorious.

However, there is another possible response.

Eagles of Death Metal, the band that played at Bataclan that night, made the following statement, issued in The Guardian on November 18th:

> "Although bonded in grief with the victims, the fans, the families, the citizens of Paris, and all those affected by terrorism, we are proud to stand together, with our new family, now united by a common goal of love and compassion."

This opens up for a better response and reminds me of the mission we have as followers of Jesus. Let me quote Michael Frost/Alan Hirsch, The Faith of Leap, p. 19:

> "For good or ill, we are players in the living drama going on around us. God has designed us as decision makers in his very image, as agents of the kingdom, not only to partake in history, but to prayerfully shape and direct it in his name as a true act of worship.

>And the part we play will depend largely on a clear sense of our mission, on the level of intentionality in what we do, and on the fortitude and integrity with which we do it. (…) It will also depend on the guide that we follow in that endeavor."

You and I may not be able to stop terrorism and solve all the problems connected to it. However, we can remain the masters of our minds and our faith. Guarding our feelings and our attitudes. Caring for each other, building trust relationships and community wherever we go. Muslims included.

Overcoming fear by practicing love.

Creating expressions of true humanity.
