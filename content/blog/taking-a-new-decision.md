Following Jesus requires a decision, and no matter your background, it’s always a new decision.

Why can it be so hard to take that decision?

Would it mean that your former decisions, traditions and habits, your arguments, convictions and priorities become meaningless? 

Would it mean that *all* was wrong?

Not necessarily. Probably, it all was right, based on the 
information you had at that time. But now you know more or have a better understanding. And now you feel the need for a change.

Or is it so hard, because it would require unaffordable costs of time or money or other sacrifices?


Or could it be fear? The fear of the unknown, of taking a risk?

Or could it be your comfort or your complacency? You simply find it too much 
a challenge to leave your first decision? 
After all, it has worked out for you for such 
a long time. And it’s also in line with your social surroundings and accepted by them. (”What would my friends say? And my relatives?”)

Whatever the reason, what will you do?

Will you let your fear or complacency or tradition or habit be strong enough to override your desire for a new and better decision? Or would you give in to peer pressure of sticking with your tribe or the group that you joined when you made your first decision? 

It takes humility and courage to make a new decision.

And trust in the voice of your heart.
