Following Jesus requires a decision. 

No matter what's our background, it’s always a new decision.

Why can it be so hard for some of us to take that decision?

Would it mean that our former decisions, our traditions and habits, our arguments, convictions and priorities become meaningless? 

Would it mean that *all* was wrong?

No, your first decision wasn’t necessarily wrong. Neither your tradition nor your habits. They probably were right, based on the information you had at the time when you made the decision or followed that tradition or established those habits. But now you have more information and a better understanding. And now you feel the need for a change.

Or is it so hard, because it would require unaffordable costs of time or money or other impossible sacrifices?

Most probably not.

Or could it be fear? The fear of the unknown, the fear of taking a risk?

Or could it be your comfort or your complacency? You simply find it too much a challenge to leave your first decision or tradition or habit? After all, all this has worked out for you for such a long time. And it’s also in line with your social surroundings and accepted by them. (”What would my friends say? And my relatives?”)

So whatever the reason, what will you do?

Will you let your fear or complacency or tradition or habit be strong enough to override your desire for a new and better decision? Or would you give in to peer pressure of sticking with your tribe or the group that you joined when you made your first decision? 

It takes humility and courage to deviate from the crowd, to admit a necessary change and to actually execute it. 

And it takes trust in the voice of your heart.
