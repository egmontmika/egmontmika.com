Sometimes it's time for a change.

From time to time, following Jesus requires a new decision.
Why can it be so hard to take that decision?

Would it mean that your former decisions, traditions and habits, your arguments, 
convictions and priorities become meaningless? 

Would it mean that *all* was wrong?

Not necessarily. Probably, it all was right, based on the 
information you had at that time. But now you know more. Now you have a
better understanding. 

Now you feel the need for a change.

So, what will you do?

Will you let your tradition or habit or convenience be strong enough to override your desire 
for a new and better decision? 

Or will you give in to peer pressure of sticking with
your "tribe", your relatives and friends or your group (for what will they say?)?

Many times, it takes humility and courage to make a new decision.

And trust in the voice of your heart.
