Time Savers

Time is precious. Time is limited. Time is running out.

Life is running out.

Civilisation, in turn, has blessed us with an abundance of time savers: dishwashers and washing machines, vacuum cleaners, lawn mowers, cars, airplanes, cellphones, computers…

Where does all the ”saved” time go? 

With calendars full to the brim, people seem to have less time than ever before. In order to meet with a friend, I may have to book an appointment several weeks ahead. 

The truth is that none of us is literally ”saving” any time. 

On the contrary, many of these time savers may rather shorten our lives. We may seriously damage our health by eating too much time saving, processed foods or by doing too much time saving computer work. Not to mention the stress created by a time saving life style. Some of us shorten their lives drastically by getting killed during a time saving car trip….

What all these time savers actually give us is not more time but more choice. More than ever before we can choose what to do with our time. Choose what is important to us or meaningful.

Sadly enough, we often end up filling that time with even more computer work or more car trips. Working for more money, enabling us to buy even more time savers.

What are your choices?
