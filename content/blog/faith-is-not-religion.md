Following Jesus calls for faith. Yet, faith and religion aren’t the same. Faith isn't religion.

Don't confuse those two!

Typically, religion is made up of two components. There is a set of statements about what a group of people, an organization, a movement, or a society consider to be true. And there are rules, rituals and traditions to follow.

Faith is beyond those things. It’s originated in another realm; it springs forth out of your spirit.

Faith is your trust in God, which includes your genuine actions based on that trust.

Faith is always personal. It's yours, not your parents' or anyone else's. And it's never institutional. It’s rooted deep inside of you, generating qualities such as confidence, motivation, vision, courage, mental strength, patience, endurance… Faith is the ultimate motor of your actions.

Religion is great as long as it provides a positive, supporting environment for your faith. At its best, it amplifies your faith.Then, religion may work out for you. However, that’s not always the case. It can also result in the opposite.

Religion can quench your faith.

While faith lets you imagine what could be possible and encourages you to act on that imagination, religion reinforces the status-quo.

Religion makes you fit in, not stand out.

Religion is like a heavy blanket overlaid on top of your faith. As long as you accept its boundaries or don’t ever recognize that it is there, you can feel fine and enjoy whatever it offers.

However, for those who want to take initiative and practice an amount of freedom that is beyond those boundaries, the blanket turns into an iron ceiling, mentally and spiritually.

Once you reach that point,  you have only two options. Adapt to the status quo and let it quench your faith, or leave.

In case you are strong enough to leave, people may wonder, whether you lost your faith. Probably, rather the opposite is true. Stepping out can be the very consequence of your faith. You leave because your faith requires it. What you leave is not your faith, but just a certain temporary religious, social or cultural expression of it.

Leaving, though, is never a convenient step. To others it may even look like a heresy or a betrayal. Or they envy you, but consider the price for themselves too high.

For you, however, that doesn’t matter anymore. For you, it has become a necessity.
