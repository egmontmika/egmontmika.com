The most precious, the most challenging and at the same time the most rewarding conversations I can think of are the missional conversations with someone who doesnâ€™t know Jesus, yet.  

 These are those sweet moments of grace, when heaven touches the earth, with Jesus present and someone with an open heart at the same table with you. And as you continue to meet, you can see the Spirit working conviction, redemption and transformation - a new life is about to take form.

This is what happened when Jesus met the Samaritan woman. And ever since has His Spirit been flowing in thousands and thousands of similar conversations, generation after generation, whenever and wherever a disciple connected with someone and shared the good news.

To see this happen is our privilege, our joy and our reward as followers of Jesus.

This is what we are called to. This is what Jesus empowered us to. And this is what He is absolutely passionate about.

There is no need to wait for a better time. According to the Lord it's harvest time now and the harvest to be brought in is greater than ever before. Just open your eyes, it's all around you.

So be ready at all times and let the Spirit lead you. There might be one of these sweet moments of grace prepared for you today.
