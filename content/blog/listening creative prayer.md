Listening Creative Prayer

When you pray, who does most of the talking?

You or the Lord?

Your answer will depend on where your focus is. Whether it is on yourself and your problems and desires, or on Him and His concerns? Depending on your focus you either mostly talk or mostly listen. 

God is looking for people who are eager to listen. 

He wants you to hear what He has to say and what He wants to do. He wants you to learn from him and connect with His plans and purposes. 

And with His creative ways.

People who listen have switched their focus from ”I” and ”me” to ”You” and ”Your”. For you, this changes your prayer life radically. 

Now you see your own life and everyone around you in a new light. You see from His perspective. And you see what He wants to do.

As a result, your long prayer talks will get shorter and shorter and will finally be reduced to a minimum, while the time you spend listening to Him will extend all the more.

After listening, God’s agenda is yours, and your agenda is the same as God’s. Through His Spirit you can see what He wants to do and you can speak it out prophetically. Most probably, you also know your first step towards that goal, and you can take it.

This is the way you can make your prayers creative, in the sense that they actually create something. God is the one who creates, yet, he does it through you, through the words you speak and the actions you take according to these words. 

Thus, you call something that does not exist into being, and you start acting as if it already existed.

Along the way God makes it happen.
