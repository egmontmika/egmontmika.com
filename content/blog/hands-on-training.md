Making disciples requires hands-on training.

* If you want to learn how to walk, you'll have to start walking.
* If you want to learn how to ride a bike, you'll have to start biking.
* If you want to learn how to swim, you'll have to start swimming.

No matter how lousy it makes you feel at the moment.

If you want to learn how to make a disciple, you'll have to start doing it. No matter how hard it seems in the beginning.

There is no substitute for hands-on training.

* Listening to sermons alone will not take you there, no matter how many more you will hear.
* Bible studies alone will not take you there, no matter how many more you will do.
* Prayer alone will not take you there, no matter how much more you will pray.

Worship services alone will not take you there.

If you want to obey Jesus' command you'll have to do it. Start making a disciple.

There is no substitute.
