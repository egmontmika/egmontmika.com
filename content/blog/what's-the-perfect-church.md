Let’s face it, there is no such thing as the “perfect church”.

This is, at least, what most Christians would agree on.

Why then does it make us surprised and upset and disappointed and angry, or even desperate whenever something has happened in the church that absolutely should not have happened? It's irritating, because it didn’t happen out there, in ”the world”, but among us, the saints.

Disgusting! How could this ever happen!

But wait a minute! Why are we so surprised and disappointed?

It’s because we have an idea of what the church is or “really” should be, and we expect it to match up to that picture. Yet, it failed! Again!

Where does this picture come from?

Is this the picuture we get from the Bible and the first church? Or is it just our own idealized, romantic view? Our illusion of the church?

At least, this is not how Jesus viewed his first twelve disciples. They were anything but perfect. And it’s not the picture we get of the first church in Jerusalem. And definitely not of the churches that Paul wrote to. Would the Early Church ever have matched up to our expectations?

Admitted, according to both Jesus and Paul, the church has a high calling, a high identity, and a high goal. And she’s on her way to reach that goal. One day, in fact, she’s going to be that “bride without spots and wrinkles”, by God’s grace. That’s also in the bible.

However, we are not there, yet. That’s the reality we are facing here and now. We’ll have to see that and admit it. Then work on it patiently, and move on, step by step, overcoming every back-drop, never giving up.

There is hope. And there is grace enough to carry us through.

One thing is for sure, Jesus doesn’t get nervous when looking at our failures. And he will never get desperate.  Obviously, he knew from the beginning what kind of people we are, and must have taken that into account.

Therefore, he commanded us to forgive each other. And in his view that’s nothing to compromise with, because it is the only way we can progress. Moreover, he gave us the mandate to forgive in his name, by his grace.

That’s powerful! That changes everything!

And in his sight, that makes us perfectly perfect.
