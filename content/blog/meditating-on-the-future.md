No use to spend hours meditating on the past.

You may say that you can learn from it. That’s right, but any useful lesson you can learn doesn’t take more than a few seconds or maybe minutes. 

The question is, What are you going to do with your insight? After all, the past is gone, and it will never come back and give you another chance.

In contrast, meditating on the future can be very rewarding. 

The future gives you opportunities to make a better decision, do a better job, find a better solution, avoid another mistake. The future is filled with possibilities. And choices. Good choices, if you are prepared.

In this respect, meditating on it is a good way to start. It will help you to find out what really is important to you, to focus mentally and to build your confidence.

Later on, whenever the opportunity pops up, you will not fall into the same pit again, but this time do it better. 

For a disciple of Jesus, isn’t this very much like ”waiting on the Lord”? 

Seeking him for a clear understanding of what to do, building up your faith, leaving things behind that will hinder you, and learning things that will help you.

It may take some time until the Lord opens the door. The greater the task the longer time you may have to prepare and wait. There is no use of cutting down that waiting time and rushing ahead of the Lord. Rather, use it well by preparing evenbetter. Typically, there is much more time necessary than you ever expect.

Yet, in due time, the Lord will give you the green light. Then, all you have to do is step out into his prepared ways and watch him do his work through you.

You’ll be amazed!
