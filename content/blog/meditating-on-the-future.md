No use to spend hours meditating on the past regretting. 

You may say that you can learn from it. Yes, but any useful lesson you can learn doesn’t take more than a few seconds or maybe minutes. Anything longer than that is destructive. The past is gone, and it will never come back.

In contrast, meditating on the future can be very rewarding. 

The future gives you opportunities to make a better decision, do a better job, find a better solution, avoid another mistake. The future is filled with possibilities. And choices - good choices, if you are prepared.

In this respect, meditating on the future is a good way to start. From now on, what do you want to do with your insights from the past? Meditating will help you to find out what really matters to you, to focus mentally and to build your confidence.

Later on, whenever another opportunity may pop up, you will not fall into the same pit, but this time do it better. 

For a disciple of Jesus, isn’t this very much like ”waiting on the Lord”? 

Seeking him for a clear understanding of what to do, not looking back but ahead, building up your faith, leaving things behind that will hinder you, and learning new things that may help you.

It may take some time until the Lord opens the door that you need in order to take action. The greater the task the longer time you may have to prepare and wait. There is no use of cutting down that waiting time, though, and rushing ahead of the Lord. Rather, use it well by preparing even better. Leaving even more things behind. For Spirit ledd endeavours, typically there is much more preparation necessary than you ever expect.

Yet, in due time, the Lord will give you the green light. Then, all you have to do is step out into his prepared ways and watch him do his work through you.

You’ll be amazed!
