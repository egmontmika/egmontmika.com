No use to spend hours meditating on the past - regretting. 

You may say that you can learn from it. Yes, but any useful lesson from the past 
doesnâ€™t take more than a few seconds, or maybe minutes. Anything 
longer than that would be destructive. The past is gone and will 
never come back.

In contrast, meditating on the future can be very rewarding. 

The future gives you opportunities to make a better decision,find a better solution, 
get better results, and avoid the old mistake. The future is filled with 
possibilities and choices - good choices. That is, if you let go the past and get prepared. 

Did you let go? Are you ready to get prepared?

Then, you can start your future right away - by meditating on it. Admitted, the actual work still needs to be done.

Yet, you gave yourself a good start.
