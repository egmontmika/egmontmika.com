No use to spend hours meditating on the past regretting. 

You may say that you can learn from it. Yes, but any useful lesson 
doesnâ€™t take more than a few seconds or maybe minutes. Anything 
longer than that would be destructive. The past is gone, and it will 
never come back.

In contrast, meditating on the future can be very rewarding. 

The future gives you opportunities to make a better decision, do a better job, 
find a better solution, avoid the old mistake. The future is filled with 
possibilities and choices - good choices. 

Are you prepared?

In this respect, meditating on the future is a good way to start. From now on, 
what do you want to do with your insights from the past? Find out what really 
matters to you, then focus on it mentally and build your confidence.

Later on, whenever another opportunity may pop up, you will not fall into 
the same pit.

This time you will do better.
