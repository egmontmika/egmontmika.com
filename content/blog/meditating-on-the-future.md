No use to spend hours pondering on the past - regretting. 

You may say that you can learn from it. Yes, but any useful lesson from the past doesnâ€™t take more than a few seconds, or maybe minutes. Anything 
longer than that may become destructive. The past is gone and will 
never come back.

In contrast, pondering on the future can be very rewarding. 

The future gives you opportunities to make a better decision, find a better solution, get better results, and avoid the old mistakes. The future is filled with possibilities and choices - good choices. 

That is, if you let go the past and get prepared. 

Are you prepared?

You can start your future right away - by pondering. Admitted, the actual work still needs to be done.

Yet, pondering is a good start.
