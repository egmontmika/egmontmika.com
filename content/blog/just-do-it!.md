There is no better way of teaching and learning than the hands-on training in real life situations.

* If you want to learn how to walk, you'll have to start walking.
* If you want to learn how to ride a bike, you'll have to start biking.
* If you want to learn how to swim, you'll have to start swimming.

No matter how lousy you may feel in the beginning, you'll just have to do it.

In the same way: If you want to learn how to make a disciple, you'll have to start making one.

* More sermons will not take you there, no matter how good they are.
* More Bible studies will not do it, no matter how much knowledge you get.
* Neither will more prayer, no matter how much more you pray...

...if you never take the first step.

There is no other way.

Just do it!
