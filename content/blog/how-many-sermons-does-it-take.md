How many sermons does it take to make a disciple?

Probably one. Or maybe a few. The rest is modelling. 

Modelling is not done from the pulpit, but in everyday life. By sharing experiences, communicating kingdom values, demonstrating these values and explaining the hows and whys. Learning to listen and to follow the Spirit.

Admitted, that can take a life time. There will always be something more to learn, more to understand and more to practice. But when is a disciple ready to reach out and make another disciple?

How many sermons does it take to make a disciple maker?

Probably none. Again, disciple makers are not made from the pulpit, and not by attending classes. But by doing it. By jumping the leap.

How about you?

If you have been a disciple of Jesus for a while, letâ€™s say a year or two or three, you can do it. And if you still feel you need help, find someone who is engaged in this kind of work and ask that person, if you may join him or her for a while.

Find such a person.
