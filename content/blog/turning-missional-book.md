Hi friends!

Those who used to read my blog posts may have wondered why I stopped writing  more than two years ago. The reason is that I during the process of writing blog posts came to the conviction that I should write a book instead. A book on missional discipleship. Now the book is finished and available on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08MCN8TK6?pf_rd_r=18VP3SDTM7J5R5W6NB4F&pf_rd_p=6fc81c8c-2a38-41c6-a68a-f78c79e7253f).

Here is a short description from the foreword by Roger Thoman, Appleseed Ministry Group:

> "This book gives a sharp diagnosis of the church today and the typical churchgoer who is going through the motions of religion. But it is more than just a critique of institutional forms of church. It provides a pathway for anyone who wants to move from sitting to going and from a place of living in comfort-zone to the spiritual adventure of following Jesus. Turning Missional clearly identifies the emotional and spiritual obstacles to becoming missional disciples and helps anyone interested to overcome these pitfalls and move forward. It provides a blueprint for actually walking out the reality of a life that is devoted to the things that grip the heart of God.

> If you hunger for more than your current church-going experience, this book will point you toward a life of becoming a disciple of Jesus who learns the most exciting vocation of all: making others to be disciples of Jesus."
