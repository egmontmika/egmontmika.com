Life's value is not defined by its highlights.

Sunday worship services may leave the impression that living the Christian life is a series of elegant meetings. Jumping from celebration to celebration. Like a butterfly, from flower to flower. Looking for the next sensation, the next spiritual experience. With lots of smiles.

Nothing could be more wrong than that.

Rather, it’s the other way around. Your valuable life is the life you live in between the highlights. It’s your daily walk. Including every day, every hour, every minute.

No part of your life is too low, not to be noticed. There is nothing to hide, nothing to be ashamed of, nothing unworthy. Everything counts.

Everything is valuable.

In the Kingdom of God, there are no shadows. Everything is in His light. Also those moments when you come home from work feeling sweaty and dirty. Exhausted or maybe even discouraged. When you are sick or people have betrayed you and everything seems dark. Still, you are in His light. Still, your life is valuable.

YOU are valuable.

One day, when you will look back and draw a balance, it will not be the highlights that added most value to your life, but your relationships. Your daily habits and your daily work. 

The fruit of your faithfulness and consistency. 

And your love.
