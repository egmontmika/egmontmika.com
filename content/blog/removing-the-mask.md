He was a pastor, a gifted preacher and a brilliant Bible school teacher, respected and loved by his church and his large family, particularly known and appreciated for his books and seminars on family relationships.

Then the unexpected happened.

In short: One day, he left his wife and family, quit his ministry and moved to a far away country in order to start all over again, leaving his family, co-workers and church members behind in shock.

In a letter, he described his desperation, revealing that he had been depressed for a longer period, feeling like a failure and even planned to take his life.

For the last three years he had been trying to keep a mask and fulfill his duty as a pastor, trying to perform whatever was expected.

But now he couldn’t do it anymore. The mask had to be removed.

Tragic and alarming!

This story may seem exceptional, at least in its final, shocking consequences. However, wearing a mask isn’t that exceptional, not among people in general, neither among believers. In fact, it seems to be a behavior particularly found in certain church cultures, practiced by common people like you and me.

It’s not necessary to be a pastor in order to fall into that pit. Anyone can end up there.

So, what could make believers and Christian workers resort to wearing a mask? And why is it so common? What can we learn from this tragedy?

The reason seems to be fear. The fear of failing and being exposed and rejected, maybe due to a gap between a person's abilities and the leadership position he was given and unable to fill. In order to compensate for the lack, he resorts to wearing a mask, pretending an ability or spirituality he does not possess.

We could call it hypocrisy, yet, let me add another aspect.

Could it also be due to the gap, which the people around him produced by expecting him to be someone else than he really is. This person may be totally honest, not pretending anything, nevertheless, people identify him with the role they want him to play according to their concept, according to how they picture him in their imagination.

They may want to see him as the strong leader, the man or woman of God, the apostle, the prophet or the performer of miracles, someone who makes things happen, things that satisfy their desire for affirmation and spiritual experiences.

This could be rapid church growth or anything supernatural, something that gives them a sense of God’s presence, anything that produces the desired spiritual kick they might be missing in their own private lives.

No matter, whether it is a projection of people's desires or a compensation of their own failures, a tragedy like the one described should not only be seen as the one person's but also the people’s responsibility, as the outcome of a church environment, a hype that people bought into and cultivated, leaders as well as the ones being lead.

So, who is responsible for the mask? And who should remove it?

What we need is not a thousand more super stars and stage heroes and their success stories, but the grace that the Lord once gave to everyone of us for all times. His grace that we can enjoy and share with each other, to walk the common daily walk of life in love, faith and hope, and in gratitude.

Being able to lift the burden of guilt and shame from each other and together enjoy our lives in God's redemption.

Removing our masks - becoming vulnerable.

And authentic.
