Removing the Mask

He was a pastor, a gifted preacher and a brilliant Bible school teacher, respected and loved by his church and his great family, particularly known and appreciated for his books and seminars on family relationships.

Then the unexpected happened.

In short: One day, he left his wife and family, quit his ministry and moved to a far away country in order to start all over again. His family, co-workers and church members were left behind in shock.

In a letter, he described his desperation, revealing that he had been depressed for a longer period, feeling like a failure and even planned to take his life. For the last three years he had been trying to keep a mask and fulfill his duty as a pastor, performing whatever was expected of him.

But now he couldn’t do it anymore. The mask had to be removed. Tragic and alarming!

This story may seem exceptional, at least in its final, shocking consequences. However, wearing a mask isn’t that exceptional, not among people in general, neither among believers. In fact, it seems to be a behaviour particularly found in certain church cultures, practiced by common people like you and me.

It’s not necessary to be a pastor in order to fall into that pit. Anyone can end up there.

So, what could make believers and Christian workers resort to wearing a mask? And why is it so common? What can we learn from this tragedy?

The reason seems to be fear. The fear of failing and being exposed and rejected. K.P. Yohannan, founder and leader of Gospel for Asia, explains it as follows:

”It all has to do with our inner life. On the outside we have the needed head-knowledge, expertise and gifting to accomplish great things for God, but on the inside we have not grown up. Our spiritual maturity and Christlike character has not developed enough to be able to support the ministry or leadership position we were given. In order to compensate for the lack of our inner life, we resort to wearing a mask and pretending to have a spirituality we don’t possess.”

According to K.P. Yohannan, the reason is the gap between a person’s inner and outer life and the fear of getting exposed. In short, it seems to be hypocrasy.

Yet, let me add another aspect.

Could it also be the gap between me and the people, between who I am and what the people around me expect me to be? I may be totally honest, not pretending anything, nevertheless, people identify me with the role they want me to play according to their concept, according to how they picture me in their imagination.

People may want to see in me the strong leader, the ”man of God”, the prophet or the performer of miracles, someone who makes things happen, something that satisfies their desire for spiritual experiences.

This could be rapid church growth or anything supernatural, anything that makes them experience what they sense as God’s presence. Anything that gives them the desired spiritual kick they might be missing in their private lives.

No matter, if it is a projection of their desires or a compensation of their failures, it’s not primarily the man’s but the people’s responsibility.
It’s the outcome of a church culture that everyone became a part of, leaders as well as all the people who bought into this kind of hype.

So, who is creating the mask? And who should remove it?

What we need is not a thousand more stage performers and their success stories, but the grace that already is given and can be shared,  helping each other to walk the common daily walk of life in faith and thankfulness.

Removing the mask and be authentic.
