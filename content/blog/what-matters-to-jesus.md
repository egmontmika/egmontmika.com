First of all, it’s the glory of his Father in Heaven. To honor Him and to carry out His will. How does he do that? 

By caring for people. 

By loving the ones the Father loves. By giving his life for those who don’t know the Father and don’t love Him.

For Jesus, honoring the Father and caring for people are inseparable.

Today the Father is about to prepare humanity for eternity and build His universal family. And He does this through His Spirit and through everyone following Jesus. As a disciple of Jesus you are the Father’s agent of His love in this time and in this world.

You can lift your hands and sing worship songs, you can fast and spend hours in prayer in order to honor God. Yet, if the outcome is not that you do His will and care for the people He wants to reach with His love, then you are just glorifying yourself and caring for your own needs.

You can’t honor God without caring for the ones He cares for.

There is no doubt about what matters to Jesus.

The burning question is, what is it that matters to you and me?
