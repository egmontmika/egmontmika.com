Brainwashing – the cleansing of your mind – can be something quite positive.

It all depends on who is doing it, how it is done, and what the purpose is.

Just consider these words from an apostle:

 “Do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind.” (Ro 12:2 NIV)

Again our questions of interest: Who is doing it, how is it done, and what is the purpose?

My answers would be:

1) You doing it  
 2) with the help of the Spirit  
 3) in order to reach maturity.

Maturity is what you see when you look at Jesus. Becoming more and more like him is God’s agenda for you. In fact, it’s an indispensable ingredient of discipleship. And as a follower of Jesus, this is what you are expected to get engaged in.

With all of your heart.

You do it by meditating on God’s lordship and holiness, on his words and his ways of seeing things from his perspective. It’s not a program or special activity. And it's not something you do at certain times of the day or the week. Rather, it’s an on-going process. At all times.

You do it by filling your mind with everything that comes from God’s mind.

This causes you to constantly evaluate your motives for what you are doing and thinking. And, not to forget, of what you are hiding. It also causes you to adapt new and better attitudes, to take new decisions, and to form new habits.

You do it by casting out whatever you identify as belonging to that old Adam and fill yourself with what makes you more Jesus-like.

That’s brainwashing at its best!

It's not a brutal process, but rather gentle, yet penetrating the deepest parts of your being.

Admitted, this isn’t easy. And it’s a long walk. At times it’s a struggle, probably the hardest possible for every one of us, because it's a fight against our own fallen nature. And if it were not for the power and the wisdom of his Spirit, probably none of us would ever win that battle.

On the other hand, it’s also very rewarding, more than anything else we could try to accomplish.

This kind of "brainwashing" isn't only very positive, it's a necessity for any disciple of Jesus. The results will be just glorious, like the knowledge of God and freedom from self. And along with it the peace and joy that only heaven can give.

It's for you!
