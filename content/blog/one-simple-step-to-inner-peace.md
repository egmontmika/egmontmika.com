The door to inner peace is forgiveness. 

We are talking about the kind of peace that endures everything. That is stronger than any negative experience you can think of. No matter what the circumstances. No matter what others did to you. No matter the lies, the hurt, and the deception. 

No matter the damage.

Holding onto things hurts you more than anything else. Leaves you with a far greater damage than anything people can do to you. Your ow hatred breaks you down, kills you slowly.

If you want peace, stop meditating on what happened. Stop accusing. Stop seeking revenge. Stop lamenting. Stop feeling sorry for yourself. 

Just say, Stop!

It’s a matter of decision. Anyone can do it. You can do it. 

No matter what your feelings are at the moment. Once you take that decision, your feelings will follow.
Call the person by name and shout it out loudly. 

I don’t accuse you anymore! I forgive you! You are free!

Then confess your own guilt. Again, do it loudly. And be sure, God will hear you. 

And forgive you.

He not only wants to heal your memories but take you a step further. He wants to reconcile you with himself.

If forgiveness is the door to inner peace, reconciliation with God is its foundation. Reconciliation is redemption.

Peace with God is the kind of peace that endures everything and that will last for the rest of your life. 

And after that, all the way into eternity.

So precious! 

Yet, so simple.
