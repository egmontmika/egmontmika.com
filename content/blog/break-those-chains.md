Jesus didn't establish a hierarchy of authority among his followers.

While some of his disciples expected to receive special positions in his kingdom, Jesus refused to create such a system.

He said to them, <q>You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them and their high officials exercise authority over them. Not so among you.</q>(Mt 20:25 NIV)

Surprisingly and inspite of these words, most churches are organised to function in a hierarchical manner, very much like public authorities or business companies, following a system of government that is in effect contrary to the way Jesus had in mind.

In contrast, Jesus envisioned a spiritual family with deep covenantal relationships that impossibly can be formed through bureaucracy or management. In his kingdom, we are equally submitted to Jesusâ€™ lordship. Here, authority is not delegated downward, but distributed outward, equally to everyone. Its purpose is not to control and govern people, but to advance against spiritual darkness.

As each disciple is connected to Jesus directly, every new-born believer has the same opportunity to get connected to him, under his authority, not under another disciple, albeit a leader or a teacher. There is equal access, equal empowerment, and equal status for everyone.

Hierarchies with their chains of authority are no valid expressions for what the church is or should be. In fact, these systems are counterproductive to what Jesus had in mind.

Therefore, let's free ourselves and one another. Let's break those chains!
