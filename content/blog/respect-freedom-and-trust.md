When Jesus commanded his disciples to go out and make disciples, they understood that as building a master-disciple relationship. The apostle Paul translated that into his greco-roman world by instead talking about a father-son relationship. Today, we often use the term *mentorship*. Still, it's the same content, the same mission. It's the mission that Jesus gave us.

Mentorship requires trust.

And trust presupposes respect and freedom.

For a mentor this means respecting another person’s background and personality, her opinion, taste, religion, or whatever she brings along. Also her negative sides. It’s possible to show respect without necessarily agreeing.

Furthermore, it means respecting that person’s decisions.  Granting her the freedom to live her life and follow her own decisions. This includes the freedom to say ”yes” or ”no” to Jesus, and  to you as her mentor.

Respect and freedom - these are the necessary preconditions for trust.

Trust is a relationship. You can’t buy it, neither do you get it by begging or arguing or manipulating. And you never build trust by just “using” someone for your purposes. There is no such way.

Trust grows slowly. You’ll have to build it, patiently and carefully. By being consistent in your actions and transparent in your motives.

Trust needs to be cultivated, not managed. There is a world of difference between those two.

Respect, freedom and trust - you can see them in Jesus’ way of meeting people, as three expressions of his love.

As his disciples and communicators of that love,  we can never depart from respect, freedom and trust. If we ignore any of these, we loose our mentor relationship.

Therefore, acting Jesus-like means:

- Showing respect, even when met with disrespect.

- Granting freedom,  even when controlled, manipulated or threatened.

- Building trust, even when being undeserved.

You can start out with any acquaintance, on any level of relationship. Sometimes, though, you'll have to start out from scratch. It isn’t always easy.  People aren’t easy. For you as a mentor, it’s an investment into another person’s life. An investment of your love, time and energy, although with no guarantees.

However when successful, it’s an investment that produces good fruit. All the way to eternity.
