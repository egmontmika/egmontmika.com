      <p>I am writing on discipleship, community and mission, basically from two perspectives:</p>
    <p>1) What were the original concepts of discipleship, community and mission that Jesus gave to his first disciples, and what were the practices of the early church?</p>
    <p>2) How can we, in view of common opinions, religious traditions and cultural trends, translate that into our time and world and be genuine and trustworthy followers of Jesus? </p>

        <p>Don’t work FOR the Lord! Work WITH him!</p>

<p>Why are there so many discouraged and burned-out pastors? Why do so many leave the ministry? Didn’t Jesus say that his burden would be light?</p>

<p>Maybe ministry has become too heavy, because too much has been added by man. Too much of human ambitions and desires to influence and accomplish and control. Too much of duties, worries and fear.</p>

<p>Jesus simply expects us to follow him and make disciples. Then, naturally, we take care of each other as a family.</p>

<p>He isn’t pushing, but leading.</p>

<p>You can do as little or as much as you are able to, or have faith for, or think that you can afford. In this way, your burden is self-regulating. It never grows beyond your ability and your faith. Still, it can grow, slowly enough to enable you to grow along with it.</p>

<p>I don’t think we need to make up a great vision or strategy or plan, just because this is what all the leadership books tell us and what every great church seems to have. It&rsquo;s just a guessing anyway. And a burden. Or even a curse.</p>

<p>And we don’t need to prove our spirituality or ability as a leader to anyone, neither to ourselves. The Lord leads by his Spirit and defines what success is, and he alone is to be honoured.</p>

<p>So, don’t worry.</p>

<p>Don’t worry about &ldquo;your ministry&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s not yours anyway, but Jesus&rsquo;. And don&rsquo;t submit to wrong expectations from others. Instead, find out what the Lord has prepared for you.</p>

<p>Then, join in WITH him!</p>

        <p>Jesus said: “Go and make disciples!” As a disciple of Jesus, how do those words rank on your list?</p>

<p>When you think of your work, your spare time, your daily routines, and weekly obligations, including your spiritual engagements and church activities, where on that list would you place your response to Jesus’ words about making disciples?</p>

<p>Maybe you have already made some disciples, or just one, or maybe none. Or maybe you are just about to make one, or planning to. Or have tried and given up, or never tried, but would like to.</p>

<p>Sometimes our routines, habits and obligations crowd out the most important things in life. And most often our church culture with all its programs, activities and obligations keeps us from caring enough for another person and from taking the time, the effort and the sacrifice that it takes to make a disciple.</p>

<p>Yet, whom shall we blame?</p>

<p>No matter how glorious or how lousy you and I may feel about it, this is a new year and today is a new day and along with it comes the freedom for a new decision and a new start. It’s up to you and me how we respond to Jesus.</p>

<p>Disciple making isn’t easy for anyone.</p>

<p>Yet, it’s possible for those who rank it high on their list.</p>
