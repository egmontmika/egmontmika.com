      <header><h1>My Theme</h1></header>
      <p>I am writing on discipleship, community and mission, basically from two perspectives:</p>
    <p>1) What were the original concepts of discipleship, community and mission that Jesus gave to his first disciples, and what were the practices of the early church?</p>
    <p>2) How can we, in view of common opinions, religious traditions and cultural trends, translate that into our time and world and be genuine and trustworthy followers of Jesus? </p>

        <p>You can’t save the whole world.</p>

<p>However, there is at least one for whom you can make all the difference. The difference between life and death.</p>

<p>There is a well-known story about a man, who on his morning walk along the beach watches a boy picking up starfishes and throwing them back into the water. When asked about his doing the boy replied, I’m saving starfishes. If they stay on the beach, they will die.</p>

<p>Looking along the beach and imagining the hundreds of starfishes still lying there the man shook his head. You will not be able to save them all, he said. Maybe not, the boy replied, and by picking up another starfish and throwing it back into the water he continued, For this one, it makes all the difference.</p>

<p>As a follower of Jesus, you may not be able to save the whole world. However, to the ones you reach with the gospel, it will make all the difference.</p>

<p>The difference between life and death, even if it was only one.</p>

<p>Let it be at least one.</p>
