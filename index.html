      <p>I am writing on discipleship, community and mission, basically from two perspectives:</p>
    <p>1) What were the original concepts of discipleship, community and mission that Jesus gave to his first disciples, and what were the practices of the early church?</p>
    <p>2) How can we, in view of common opinions, religious traditions and cultural trends, translate that into our time and world and be genuine and trustworthy followers of Jesus? </p>

          <p><time>2017/04/12</time>&nbsp;&nbsp;300 words</p>
        </header>
        <p>You can hear an inspiring message. You can read a life-changing book.
You can get overwhelmed by a new insight. Yet, see nothing change.</p>

<p>Why can it be like that?</p>

<p>For most of us, consuming such content just isn’t strong enough
to break through the habits and mental strongholds that we have built up over time.
Not strong enough to overcome our desire for comfort and to crack our fear.
We rather hold on to a lousy status-quo that makes us feel safe than take a step into the unknown.</p>

<p>This is why a personal crisis can work as a door opener, but only if it
is deeper than our desire for comfort and stronger than our fear.</p>

<p>In order to move forward, good insights are just not enough.
Probably we also need, from time to time, a period of destabilisation. That is, a crisis.</p>

<p>The secret of success is to accept the crisis and make it your friend. Take
 advantage of the insecurity that comes along with it, collect your strength and intentionally work for a break-through. This is the time to do it. Not looking behind, but focussing on the future.</p>

<p>For moving forward, a crisis can be inestimably valuable. Don&rsquo;t let it become a stumbling block.</p>

<p>Make it a stepping stone.</p>

        <p>Just make this phone call&hellip;.</p>

<p>Then prepare the dinner, pick up the kids, clean the house, buy a birthday present, fix the bike, get a haircut, wash the clothes, read the manual, answer the emails… The list seems endless.</p>

<p>How do you cope with short-time pressure?</p>

<p>The question is, what is <em>important</em> and <em>urgent</em>? Not everything important is also urgent. And not everything urgent is also important. And some things that claim to be both are neither one.</p>

<p>So let’s have a look at the four options and find out how to cope with them, one by one.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Urgent <em>and</em> important. - Settle these things right away or as soon as possible.</p></li>

<li><p>Important, <em>but not</em> urgent. - Schedule a time when you want to do this or reserve a fixed time every day, week or month. Then follow that schedule.</p></li>

<li><p>Urgent, <em>but not</em> important. - Two options:</p>

<p>a. Let someone else do it.</p>

<p>b. Don’t spoil your precious recreation or family time or your best working hours with that. Maybe you can do it while commuting or sitting in a waiting room or watching the news. Or when you are too tired for more important things.</p></li>

<li><p>Not urgent <em>and not</em> important. - Two options:</p>

<p>a. Never do it. And never let your mind get occupied with it. Don’t let junkmail lie around, but trash it right away.</p>

<p>b. Write it on a seperate to-do-list for less important things and keep it there. Some matters get settled by themselves after a while. Then delete them. Or you settle them when they become urgent.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>In order to make this work, you may want to make a deal with yourself and decide about your priorities. You can’t do all things at all times.</p>

<p>Clarify for yourself what your purpose is or your mission. What do you want to accomplish or improve or maximise? Why are you into this career? Who do you want to serve?</p>

<p>Once you know your priorities, stay consistant and let them guide you. Then, confirm or renew your decision from time to time when not under pressure.</p>

<p>This will keep short-time pressure away and get you where you want.</p>
