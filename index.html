      <p>I am writing on discipleship, community and mission, basically from two perspectives:</p>
    <p>1) What were the original concepts of discipleship, community and mission that Jesus gave to his first disciples, and what were the practices of the early church?</p>
    <p>2) How can we, in view of common opinions, religious traditions and cultural trends, translate that into our time and world and be genuine and trustworthy followers of Jesus? </p>

        <p>It&rsquo;s never too late to invest in the future.</p>

<p>The best time to plant a tree was twenty years ago, it is said.
Yet, the second best time is now.</p>

<p>It’s never too late to plant a tree.</p>

<p>No matter how old you are, today you can start an education, start learning a language, start changeing a habit, start building a house, start a project&hellip;</p>

<p>Today you can invest in your future. And in others&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Our lives are far more significant than we tend to think at the moment. Every single one of us is the center of a sphere of influence. And we are reaching out, not only to the people around us during our own life time, but also to those who come after us.</p>

<p>They may not know who was the planter, yet they enjoy your tree and its fruit. And they may not always know who built that house or who started that project. Yet, they still enjoy its benefits.</p>

<p>Today you can invest.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s never too late.</p>

        <p>Just make this phone call&hellip;.</p>

<p>Then prepare the dinner, pick up the kids, clean the house, buy a birthday present, fix the bike, get a haircut, wash the clothes, read the manual, answer the emails… The list seems endless.</p>

<p>How do you cope with short-time pressure?</p>

<p>The question is, what is <em>important</em> and <em>urgent</em>? Not everything important is also urgent. And not everything urgent is also important. And some things that claim to be both are neither one.</p>

<p>So let’s have a look at the four options and find out how to cope with them, one by one.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Urgent <em>and</em> important. - Settle these things right away or as soon as possible.</p></li>

<li><p>Important, <em>but not</em> urgent. - Schedule a time when you want to do this or reserve a fixed time every day, week or month. Then follow that schedule.</p></li>

<li><p>Urgent, <em>but not</em> important. - Two options:</p>

<p>a. Let someone else do it.</p>

<p>b. Don’t spoil your precious recreation or family time or your best working hours with that. Maybe you can do it while commuting or sitting in a waiting room or watching the news. Or when you are too tired for more important things.</p></li>

<li><p>Not urgent <em>and not</em> important. - Two options:</p>

<p>a. Never do it. And never let your mind get occupied with it. Don’t let junkmail lie around, but trash it right away.</p>

<p>b. Write it on a seperate to-do-list for less important things and keep it there. Some matters get settled by themselves after a while. Then delete them. Or you settle them when they become urgent.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>In order to make this work, you may want to make a deal with yourself and decide about your priorities. You can’t do all things at all times.</p>

<p>Clarify for yourself what your purpose is or your mission. What do you want to accomplish or improve or maximise? Why are you into this career? Who do you want to serve?</p>

<p>Once you know your priorities, stay consistant and let them guide you. Then, confirm or renew your decision from time to time when not under pressure.</p>

<p>This will keep short-time pressure away and get you where you want.</p>
