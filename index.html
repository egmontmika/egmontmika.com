      <p>I am writing on discipleship, community and mission, basically from two perspectives:</p>
    <p>1) What were the original concepts of discipleship, community and mission that Jesus gave to his first disciples, and what were the practices of the early church?</p>
    <p>2) How can we, in view of common opinions, religious traditions and cultural trends, translate that into our time and world and be genuine and trustworthy followers of Jesus? </p>

        <p>Destruction doesn’t always have a  negative connotation. Many times it is an absolutely necessary part of the creative process.</p>

<p>Farm lands are created by tearing down trees, better neighborhoods from slums, new life from destructive habits. They all go through destructive processes before something new could be created.  
Sometimes, new life does not appear unless and until the old has been torn down. It’s not always possible nor is it safe to be building on top of the old.</p>

<p>Sooner or later a conflict will arise between the old and the new and you will have to make a choice. Either adjust and compromise and stay where you are, or tear down and start all over again, on a better foundation.</p>

<p>The same is true for our spiritual life.</p>

<p>A spiritual revival was never started by people whose hearts were still fixed in the past. It rather emerged from something new, a new revelation or a new and fresh spiritual encounter. And as a consequence, there was an overthrowing of the structures and expressions of the old.</p>

<p>In this way, revival not only builds, but also destroys.</p>

<p>If its destructive power scares you, you will not be able to connect to what the Lord is doing today.</p>

<p>In fact, at times the Lord himself is one who ”uproots”, ”tears down”, ”destroys” and ”overthrows” in order to ”build” and to ”plant”. (Jer 1:10)</p>

<p>Probably most of the time, it is wise to adjust, to compromise and to develop slowly. It takes time and endurance to build a house, a family, a church, a business…</p>

<p>However, there are situations when you’ll have to jump the canyon. You can’t do it in small steps.</p>

<p>In case you are in that kind of a situation, the Lord may give you wisdom and courage.</p>

<p>And faith.</p>

        <p>Discipleship is a choice.</p>

<p>You don’t just slide into being a disciple of Jesus by accident. Or wake up one morning and find yourself having arrived there.</p>

<p>It always requires a conscious decision on your behalf - your own personal decision.</p>

<p>Neither your father or mother, nor your buddies can decide that for you. Nobody else can, but you. And it’s not a matter of background, tradition, culture, age, education, talent or opinion…</p>

<p>It’s a matter of trust. Trust in God.</p>

<p>Anyone can make that decision.  Yet, it isn’t easy for anyone. You will always meet resistance. The way resistance comes can be different from person to person and it can vary in strength, but for sure, it will come..</p>

<p>It can come from the outside, from your family, your relatives, your buddies… as a slight sneering comment or a solid death threat, or anything in between.</p>

<p>It also can come from the inside, from your own thinking, your distrust and fear, or your pride and self-righteousness. Or your doubts. Or your complacency… The resistance has many faces and many expressions.</p>

<p>When facing the choice, it always seems easier to choose the other option, that is, not to follow Jesus. Or to postpone the decision. Or to pretend.</p>

<p>However, no matter how strong the resistance, you’ll always find people ready for a quality decision to follow Jesus, even in the face of persecution - truly a great decision.</p>

<p>It takes courage.</p>

<p>And trust!</p>
