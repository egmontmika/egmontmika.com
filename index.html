      <p>I am writing on discipleship, community and mission, basically from two perspectives:</p>
    <p>1) What were the original concepts of discipleship, community and mission that Jesus gave to his first disciples, and what were the practices of the early church?</p>
    <p>2) How can we, in view of common opinions, religious traditions and cultural trends, translate that into our time and world and be genuine and trustworthy followers of Jesus? </p>

        <p>Paris, November 13th, 2015 !</p>

<p>Overwhelmed and horrified by what happened that night, I asked myself, <em>What is my response to all those terror attacks in recent years, not only in the Middle East and in places “far away”, but also increasingly in Europe?</em></p>

<p>Will the horror stay with me and eventually leave me in a constant state of fear? Will it affect my attitude towards the world and the people around me, towards Muslims in general as well as towards my Muslim friends, colleagues, students and neighbours?</p>

<p>And will it possibly lead me to a reaction that ultimately feeds into a culture of resentment, distrust and fear?</p>

<p>One thing is for sure, if I let fear grip me, then the attacks have accomplished their purpose in me and the terrorists have won the victory!</p>

<p>This shall never happen!</p>

<p>Fortunately, there is another possible response.</p>

<p>‘Eagles of Death Metal’, the band that played at Bataclan that night, made the following statement, issued in <em>The Guardian</em> on November 18th:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Although bonded in grief with the victims, the fans, the families, the citizens of Paris, and all those affected by terrorism, we are proud to stand together, with our new family, now united by a common goal of love and compassion.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This view opens up for a better response and reminds me of the mission we have as followers of Jesus.</p>

<p>You and I may not be able to stop terrorism and solve all the problems connected to it. However, we can remain the masters of our minds and our faith, guard our feelings and attitudes, care for each other, build trust relationships and cultivate community - Muslims included.</p>

<p>Overcoming fear by practicing love and true humanity.</p>

<p>Taking action for a better world.</p>

        <p>Are you looking for a safe and comfortable road to travel on?</p>

<p>Then, following Jesus might not be the right choice for you.</p>

<p>Jesus never invited anyone to a safe journey. Neither did his Father. The Bible is filled with stories about men and women who knew God and faithfully followed him on a rather bumpy road with many potholes, detours and dangers.</p>

<p>Just think of Abraham, Joseph, Moses, Elijah, David, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Jesus, Paul… Their lives were characterized by dangers, hardship, risks, threats, agonies and persecution.</p>

<p>Jesus was one of them, and he didn’t promise his followers anything different from what he experienced. Least of all security and comfort.</p>

<p>However, this seems to be what millions of his followers daily pray for and expect for their lives. And churches do their best to make Christianity appear a pleasant experience.</p>

<p>And in case we let Sunday morning performances be the foremost expression of what it means to follow Jesus, this is what we communicate.</p>

<p>Yet, by filtering out the hardship, the pain, the struggle, the risks, the drop-backs, the sweat and the dirt of everyday life, we may end up reducing discipleship to a nice Sunday morning smile. That kind of religion will never stand the test of credibility. Neither the test of authenticity.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if we intentionally face those trials, the hardship and the discomfort, and not only try but actually overcome by strengthening our faith, putting our spiritual weapons into practice and standing side by side as brothers and sisters, trusting the Lord to give us a victory, we make an astonishing discovery.</p>

<p>We then find out that He is with us right there walking alongside with us, leading us through every hardship and towards our destiny. And we discover that this bumpy and tiresome road we are walking on actually is the road of our calling.</p>

<p>The road where His grace becomes most visible.</p>

<p>What a blessing!</p>
