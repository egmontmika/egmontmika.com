      <p>I am writing on discipleship, community and mission, basically from two perspectives:</p>
    <p>1) What were the original concepts of discipleship, community and mission that Jesus gave to his first disciples, and what were the practices of the early church?</p>
    <p>2) How can we, in view of common opinions, religious traditions and cultural trends, translate that into our time and world and be genuine and trustworthy followers of Jesus? </p>

        <p>You can&rsquo;t buy trust.</p>

<p>Yet, it&rsquo;s one of the greatest assets you can have. It&rsquo;s a fortune.</p>

<p>At first glance, building trust seems simple. You say what you are going to do and then do what you said. You keep your promises. You act out your words. Never giving less, rather a little more.</p>

<p>Without any hidden agenda, without cutting corners. Without faking the results. And without covering up your mistakes.</p>

<p>Without pretending.</p>

<p>Showing up on time - doing your work - completing it. Period.</p>

<p>No need to make it look fancier. No need to add more or better promises. Just keep the ones you already made. No need to improve your image; it&rsquo;s not a matter of marketing, anyway.</p>

<p>Just be the person you say you are and do what is right.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s simple, indeed, but not always easy. We hardly get it without effort and sometimes it takes great courage. And for some of us it just seems impossible, as long as we are hiding something.</p>

<p>In order to build a fortune of trust, you&rsquo;ve got to be honest. Absolutely, radically honest. At times, and for a short while, this may make you look like a looser.</p>

<p>There is a price to pay.</p>

<p>In the long run, though, honesty will pay and amount to much.</p>

<p><strong><em>Hello friends!</em></strong></p>

<p>This was my last blogpost for this season. The school year in Sweden is rapidly coming to an end and it&rsquo;s time for a summer break.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading my articles and joining me in the journey. I hope you enjoyed reading at least some of them.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be back to you in September. Would you like to get a reminder by email? Then, make sure you have signed up by entering your email address in the top right corner of this page.</p>

<p>And, in case you never commented on any of my blogposts since last fall, this is the last chance you can do it. I&rsquo;d love to hear from you.</p>

<p>Have a nice summer.
Be blessed with the joy in the Lord!</p>

<p>Yours,</p>

<p>Egmont</p>

        <p>Church isn&rsquo;t the same as a worship service.</p>

<p>Nothing you <strong><em>go to</em></strong>.</p>

<p>Neither a program nor an event. Far less a building, an organisation or a denomination. It wasn&rsquo;t that from the beginning, and it still isn&rsquo;t meant to be that today.</p>

<p>What is it, then?</p>

<p>It’s a family, a movement, a divine fellowship. A calling and a mission.</p>

<p>It’s what we are born into as followers of Jesus, redeemed through him, reconciled with our Father in heaven.</p>

<p>By his grace.</p>

<p><a href="https://molongnacua.com/being-church/?blogsub=confirmed#blog_subscription-3">Molong Nacua</a>, a Jesus follower from the Filipines, put it this way:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Church is where Christ lives, not the place where we meet. It is Christ-empowered people, a kingdom of priests for the purpose of winning against the works of the devil and establishing God&rsquo;s Kingdom.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s about who we <strong><em>are</em></strong>. In Christ. Then follow him. Listen and obey. No matter where, no matter when - everywhere, at all times.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t <strong><em>go to</em></strong> church. <strong><em>Be</em></strong> church.</p>
