      <p>I am writing on discipleship, community and mission, basically from two perspectives:</p>
    <p>1) What were the original concepts of discipleship, community and mission that Jesus gave to his first disciples, and what were the practices of the early church?</p>
    <p>2) How can we, in view of common opinions, religious traditions and cultural trends, translate that into our time and world and be genuine and trustworthy followers of Jesus? </p>

        <p><em>Hospitality is an expression of God’s character.</em></p>

<p>Our Lord is a welcoming God. He is generous, nourishing, lavish, joyful…</p>

<p>He is hospitable.</p>

<p>And this is what we are communicating to others when being hospital. It’s as easy as sharing a meal with a friend, a collegue, a neighbor, or a stranger. Or why not a beggar! God is indiscriminate.</p>

<p>He is including.</p>

<p>Your meal doesn’t have to be fancy; don’t let it be exclusive. There is no need to impress on anyone. Just share what you have, it may be abundant or little, a three-course dinner or a glas of water. Or a piece of chocolate or a banana. Just act hospitable according to the situation.</p>

<p>Actually, it’s not so much about the food, but about your attitude, what people sense when they are together with you.</p>

<p>Hospitality is an expression of grace.</p>

<p>You give people an experience of being accepted, respected, appreciated and honored. A sense of belonging without having to qualify or to argue. It breaks the power of fear and alienation and prejudice.</p>

<p>It’s an expression of freedom.</p>

<p>You create an environment of generosity, free from control and free from guilt and accusations. Also free from the need to impress and pretend. Allowing people to be who they are. Giving them your love.</p>

<p>Creating community.</p>

<p>Creating an experience of how God is.</p>

          <h1><a href='http://egmontmika.com/blog/respect-freedom-and-trust/'>Mentorship - Respect, Freedom and Trust</a></h1>

        <p><strong><em>Definition</em></strong></p>

<p>When Jesus commanded his disciples to go out and make disciples, they understood this as building a <strong><em>master-disciple</em></strong> relationship. The apostle Paul translated it into his greco-roman world by instead talking about a <strong><em>father-son</em></strong> relationship. Today, we often use the term <strong><em>mentorship</em></strong>.</p>

<p>Still, it&rsquo;s the same content, the same mission. It&rsquo;s the mission that Jesus gave us.This is how I use this term in my blog.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Mentorship - Respect, Freedom and Trust</strong></p>

<p>Mentorship requires trust.</p>

<p>And trust presupposes respect and freedom.</p>

<p>For a mentor this means respecting another person’s background and personality, her opinion, taste, religion, or whatever she brings along. Also her negative sides. It’s possible to show respect without necessarily agreeing.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it means respecting that person’s decisions.  Granting her the freedom to live her life and follow her own preferences. This includes the freedom to say “yes” or “no” to Jesus, and  also to you as her mentor.</p>

<p>Respect and freedom - these are the preconditions, but finally it’s all about trust.</p>

<p>Trust is a relationship. You can’t buy it, neither do you get it by begging or arguing or manipulating. And you never build trust by engaging someone in your projects, thus “using” her for your own purposes. There is no such way.</p>

<p>Trust grows gradually&hellip; You’ll have to build it, patiently and carefully through consistency in action, thought and motives.</p>

<p>Trust needs to be cultivated, not managed. There is a world of difference between those two.</p>

<p>Respect, freedom and trust - you can see them in Jesus’ way of meeting people, as three expressions of his love.</p>

<p>As his disciples and communicators of that love,  we can never depart from those three. If we ignore any of them, we lose our mentor relationship.</p>

<p>Therefore, acting Jesus-like means in this context:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Showing respect, even when disrespected</p></li>

<li><p>Granting freedom,  even when controlled, manipulated or threatened.</p></li>

<li><p>Building trust, even when undeserved.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>You can start out with any acquaintance, on any level of relationship. Sometimes, though, you&rsquo;ll have to start from scratch. It isn’t always easy.  People aren’t easy. For you as a mentor, it’s an investment into another person’s life. An investment of your love, time and energy, although with no guarantees.</p>

<p>However when successful, it’s an investment that produces good fruit.</p>

<p>All the way to eternity.</p>
