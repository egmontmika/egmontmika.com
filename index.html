      <header><h1>My Theme</h1></header>
      <p>I am writing on discipleship, community and mission, basically from two perspectives:</p>
    <p>1) What were the original concepts of discipleship, community and mission that Jesus gave to his first disciples, and what were the practices of the early church?</p>
    <p>2) How can we, in view of common opinions, religious traditions and cultural trends, translate that into our time and world and be genuine and trustworthy followers of Jesus? </p>

        <p>Some are late comers by habit.</p>

<p>To them, it seems all right to always show up &ldquo;just a little late&rdquo;. Nobody will take notice anyway, it seems. And others will be late as well, they think.</p>

<p>To them, coming late is all right, as long as they don’t miss the highlights and as long as they get what they are expecting. And fulfill their social duty to show up.</p>

<p>Why invest more time than necessary?</p>

<p>In contrast, others may always want to come a little earlier. Be there before the program starts. Offering a little extra time. Just for being mentally prepared. Or for encouraging the host. Or for making themselves available. Like being able to lend a helping hand for the last preparations.</p>

<p>Or for chatting with another early comer. Encourage someone who came with a need, with the desire to meet someone who would listen.</p>

<p>Coming a little earlier gives you time to connect. Time to build a relationship. Time to care.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s precious time!</p>

<p>You may not want to miss it.</p>

        <p>You can hear an inspiring message. You can read a life-changing book.
You can get overwhelmed by a new insight.</p>

<p>Yet, see nothing change.</p>

<p>For most of us, consuming such content just isn’t strong enough
to break through the habits and mental strongholds that we have built up over time.
Not strong enough to overcome our desire for comfort and to crack our fear.
We rather hold on to a lousy status-quo that makes us feel safe than take a step into the unknown.</p>

<p>This is why a personal crisis can work as a door opener, but only if it
is stronger than our desire for comfort and stronger than our fear.</p>

<p>In order to move forward, good insights are just not good enough.
Probably we also need, from time to time, a period of destabilisation. That is, a real good crisis.</p>

<p>The secret of success is to accept the crisis and make it your friend. Take
 advantage of the insecurity that comes along with it, collect your strength and intentionally work for a break-through. This is the time to do it. Not waiting for the storm to calm down neither looking behind, but focussing on the future with decisiveness.</p>

<p>For moving into a better future, a crisis can be inestimably valuable. Don&rsquo;t let it become a stumbling block.</p>

<p>Instead, make it a stepping stone.</p>
