      <p>I am writing on discipleship, community and mission, basically from two perspectives:</p>
    <p>1) What were the original concepts of discipleship, community and mission that Jesus gave to his first disciples, and what were the practices of the early church?</p>
    <p>2) How can we, in view of common opinions, religious traditions and cultural trends, translate that into our time and world and be genuine and trustworthy followers of Jesus? </p>

        <p>In Sweden, summer has arrived and it’s time to take a break.</p>

<p>For Åsa and me, this means to close down all of our regular activities and, except eating and sleeping, do other things than we usually do.</p>

<p>That’s what we call ”to rest”.</p>

<p>Like traveling both short and long distances to visit friends and relatives, staying for a while in Munich, my home city, hiking in the Alps and, last not least, discovering new places. This year, it’s going to be the lovely coast of Southern Croatia with world heritage Dubrovnik as our base.</p>

<p>Summer also means no blogging for a while, let’s say, until the end of August.</p>

<p>You can  still reach us, though, by mail or phone. And  you can still make an appointment, in case you would like to meet us in person.</p>

<p>Finally, I would like to ask you for a favor. Please, would you help me evaluate my writing and make a decision concerning how to go on after the summer? You can do this by sending me a little comment. In case you don’t feel like writing a lot or don’t have the time or think that your English isn’t good enough, I allow you to keep it very short. Just write one single word into the comment box below.</p>

<p>Write either YES or NO.</p>

<p>If you write YES, this will encourage me to go on writing in about the same way as I have done so far, while your NO will encourage me to quit.</p>

<p>Thank you so much for your response.</p>

<p>Have a nice summer! Hopefully, you will hear from me again at the end of August.</p>

<p>Yours,
Egmont</p>

        <p>Have you ever tried to change someone’s habit without success? You kept arguing, but it just didn&rsquo;t help?</p>

<p>We probably change a habit on other grounds than logical thinking. Real change is made on a much deeper, emotional or maybe even spiritual level. It’s the level where we manage things like courage and fear, trust and distrust, faith and doubt.</p>

<p>It seems to me like most of us, most of the time are not really ready for a change. Although we may not be quite happy about a certain habit, we still prefer the status quo. It just feels safer or easier; at least we know what we got and we hope that it will not get worse.</p>

<p>This is the situation every preacher is facing. While we as the audience are nodding our heads in agreement to the sermon, our inside is already blocking the change. And for not exposing our half-heartedness, we escape into pretending. However, true preaching aims at change, changed attitudes, decisions and actions, including habits.</p>

<p>How can we go on listening week after week and still stay unaffected?</p>

<p>The explanation is that listening without acting leads into passive, ritualized behavior. And listening to still more sermons leads into even deeper passivity. It immunizes against the message, makes you favor the status quo and end up in self-affirmation and complacency, the perfect setting for a convenient, religious behavior.</p>

<p>Then, listening to more sermons becomes counterproductive. It makes you feel spiritual without being it.</p>

<p>We fool ourselves when we think of having accomplished anything by just listening and agreeing.</p>

<p>On the other hand, in case we are honest and willing to change, good sermons can be quite useful and inspiring. If you are ready to change, they can help you make a good decision and then act accordingly.</p>

<p>It’s up to you and me to make it happen.</p>

I have tried so hard to get people to see their true self so they can get the help they need from God and man and it has only resulted in futile arguments as you point out! Most people just want to talk about their problems and they will go on repeating it to anyone who would listen. The only thing that can change me or anyone is time spent alone with God &hellip; unhurried time &hellip;. listening to the heart of God and giving control of my life again and again back to Him so Christ can be born in me and live in me. This is a daily struggle until the surrender is total and perfection is won in Christ!! Apostle Paul is a great example to follow!</p>
