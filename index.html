      <p>I am writing on discipleship, community and mission, basically from two perspectives:</p>
    <p>1) What were the original concepts of discipleship, community and mission that Jesus gave to his first disciples, and what were the practices of the early church?</p>
    <p>2) How can we, in view of common opinions, religious traditions and cultural trends, translate that into our time and world and be genuine and trustworthy followers of Jesus? </p>

        <p>How many sermons do you need in order to become a disciple?</p>

<p>Probably one.</p>

<p>Or maybe a few. The rest is modelling.</p>

<p>Yet, modelling is not done from the pulpit, but in everyday life. By sharing experiences, communicating kingdom values, demonstrating these values and explaining the hows and whys. Learning to listen to the Spirit and then follow.</p>

<p>By taking action.</p>

<p>Admitted, preparation can take a life time. There will always be something more to learn, more to understand and more to prepare. Yet, when is a disciple ready to reach out and make another disciple?</p>

<p>How many sermons does it take to make a disciple?</p>

<p>Probably none. Again, disciple makers are not made from the pulpit, and not in classes. Speeches and curriculums won&rsquo;t take you there.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll just have to do it. Jump the leap.</p>

<p>If you have been a disciple of Jesus for a while, let’s say for a few months or a year or maybe even two, then you can do it. And if you still feel you need help, find someone who is engaged in this kind of work and ask that person, if you may join him or her for a while. Just in order to turn the corner.</p>

<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t that be a good start?</p>

        <p>”It’s all about money!”</p>

<p>This is what we hear the critics say, while pointing at the large amounts of money collected by Christian ministries today.</p>

<p>”No, it’s not true”, we answer, believing to have a better understanding. ”It’s all about Jesus and the Good News and about saving people for eternity. It’s about mission. Of course, this costs money. The more money we give, the more people we can reach.”</p>

<p>In order to find out if this is true, let’s look at some statistics. How is the money spent and what is being accomplished?</p>

<p>According to investigations from 2015, www.thetravelingteam.org, all church members around the globe gave in one year on average 1,7% of their income to churches. 2,9% of this money was used for mission inside their own countries and 0,3% for mission in unreached, non-christian countries.</p>

<p>However, the largest part, 96,8%, was used for building the local church, that is, went mainly to salaries and buildings.</p>

<p>In contrast, we are witnessing Christian movements in the third world, and not only there, with an unparallelled growth in history, yet, with very limited financial resources. These are grass-root movements, carried by the believers and their families, many of them poor.</p>

<p>Moreover, some of these fast growing movements are operating under extremely difficult circumstances and even suffering persecution, like in China, South-Asia, and the Middle East. According to Open Doors every month hundreds of believers are killed because of their faith.</p>

<p>Nevertheless this amazing growth!</p>

<p>It’s easy to think that we could accomplish so much more for the Lord, if we just had more money and could give more.</p>

<p>Is that so?</p>
