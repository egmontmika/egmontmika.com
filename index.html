      <p>I am writing on discipleship, community and mission, basically from two perspectives:</p>
    <p>1) What were the original concepts of discipleship, community and mission that Jesus gave to his first disciples, and what were the practices of the early church?</p>
    <p>2) How can we, in view of common opinions, religious traditions and cultural trends, translate that into our time and world and be genuine and trustworthy followers of Jesus? </p>

          <h1><a href='http://egmontmika.com/blog/full-time%20or%20part-time/'>Full-Time, Part-Time or Spare-Time Ministry?</a></h1>
          <p><time>2015/09/30</time>&nbsp;&nbsp;400 words</p>
        </header>
        <p>As a disciple of Jesus, do you have a full-time or a part-time ministry?</p>

<p>Or is yours &ldquo;only&rdquo; spare-time?</p>

<p>No matter what your answer is, following Jesus is neither one. If you are his disciple, you are what you are twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. That’s neither full-time nor part-time nor spare-time.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s <em>all-the-time!</em></p>

<p>The reason for that? Discipleship isn’t based on a service, a duty or a program. It&rsquo;s neither an employment nor a hobby.</p>

<p>Discipleship is a relationship - your relationship with Jesus. And as his disciple you are a child of God; that’s a position, and again a relationship. Everything you do is done within that relationship and can be seen as an expression of it.</p>

<p>On the other hand, churches and denominations offer employments, full-time or part-time. And they engage volunteers in their spare-time.</p>

<p>All these workers have their specific responsibilities and duties. They follow the instructions, meet people&rsquo;s needs, and try to make everyone happy.</p>

<p>On top of that, they probably have an idea of listening to the Lord and try to follow him.</p>

<p>Doing both of these doesn&rsquo;t always work out so well. Following Jesus and fulfilling the requirements for an employee or volunteer aren’t automatically the same.</p>

<p>Following Jesus isn&rsquo;t the same as building an organization or pleasing the people around you. If it works out for you, that&rsquo;s fine. As long as it lasts.</p>

<p>At worst, you may feel like having to serve two masters, which can lead to conflict, frustration and stress, and sometimes even burn-out.</p>

<p>Jesus worked hard, yet never seemed to get any of these symptoms. Is it, because he only served one master and never submitted to people’s expectations?</p>

<p>Thus, he was free to listen to the Spirit and obey the One who had sent him.</p>

<p>Any-time. All-the-time.</p>

<p>Following Jesus rubs off.</p>

<p>As a disciple of Jesus, you influence your environment and the people around you. Discipleship often develops into leadership.</p>

<p>It’s a different kind of leadership, though. Different from what most people would expect. Often lacking the most typical characteristics that you usually associate with leadership, like power, position, title, status, money, popularity, image, good looks, high IQ, education, or whatever else impresses on people.</p>

<p>It’s an up-side-down leadership. It&rsquo;s built on servanthood and qualities like humility, honesty and integrity. Like trustworthiness, reliability and morality. And faithfulness and wisdom. And love. And the fear of the Lord.</p>

<p>In short, it&rsquo;s spiritual leadership.</p>

<p>True spiritual leadership is based on discipleship, that is, on being a disciple of Jesus. Discipleship comes first, spiritual leadership emerges from there.</p>

<p>You can’t lead another person along a spiritual path without first having walked that path yourself. And you can’t lead that person into a fruitful disciple relationship without being a disciple yourself. The quality of your leadership depends uttermost on the quality of your discipleship. You cannot lead a disciple beyond your own level.</p>

<p>Therefore, are you looking for a spiritual leader? Then, have a closer look at his or her discipleship. Leaders in formal positions are not necessarily fruitful disciples.</p>

<p>On the other hand, fruitful disciples can naturally develop into spiritual leaders, independently of any formal position.</p>

<p>You might be one of them.</p>

<p><strong>Amelie</strong> - LOVE IT!
I always thought I needed more of the typical leadership qualities in order to be a great leader, but I found out that there are people around me that I can disciple. That makes being a leader so easy and it comes so natural.</p>

<p><strong>Susan</strong> - I am begining to see this more and more. Strange that it should take so long for me to arrive at this conclusion&hellip;Truly desire to walk this path with any who sincerely wants to join. :)</p>
