      <p>I am writing on discipleship, community and mission, basically from two perspectives:</p>
    <p>1) What were the original concepts of discipleship, community and mission that Jesus gave to his first disciples, and what were the practices of the early church?</p>
    <p>2) How can we, in view of common opinions, religious traditions and cultural trends, translate that into our time and world and be genuine and trustworthy followers of Jesus? </p>

        <p>Are you ready to make a disciple?</p>

<p>In case your answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo; or &ldquo;not yet&rdquo;, what would you still need?</p>

<p>Jesus trained his disciples for only three and a half years, then sent them out.</p>

<p>Where they fully educated then? - No.</p>

<p>Did they master the skills of an evangelist or preacher or teacher? - Probably not.</p>

<p>In fact, they hardly had the faith necessary, nor the skill, nor the understanding.</p>

<p>Still, Jesus sent them out.</p>

<p>And whatever they were lacking, the Holy Spirit provided.</p>

<p>What they had learned by being with Jesus was not all they could have learned, if they had stayed with him for another decade, but it was good enough for a start.</p>

<p>What the Spirit needed in order to work through these people was not more education, but their willingness.</p>

<p>Are you willing?</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s face it! Believing that spending more time in church services will make you a better disciple maker is an illusion. In fact, it can be counterproductive. The longer you wait, the more you may want to stay. The less you may be willing to go out.</p>

<p>Is that so?</p>

<p>If not, what are you waiting for?</p>

          <p><time>2017/09/12</time>&nbsp;&nbsp;300 words</p>
        </header>
        <p>How many sermons do you need in order to become a disciple?</p>

<p>Probably one.</p>

<p>Or maybe a few. The rest is modelling.</p>

<p>Yet, modelling is not done from the pulpit, but in everyday life. By sharing experiences, communicating kingdom values, demonstrating these values and explaining the hows and whys. Learning to listen to the Spirit and then follow.</p>

<p>By taking action.</p>

<p>Admitted, preparation can take a life time. There will always be something more to learn, more to understand and more to prepare. Yet, when is a disciple ready to reach out and make another disciple?</p>

<p>How many sermons does it take a disciple to make another disciple?</p>

<p>Probably none. Again, disciple makers are not made from the pulpit, and not in classes. Speeches and curriculums won&rsquo;t take you there.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll just have to do it. Jump the leap.</p>

<p>If you have been a disciple of Jesus for a while, let’s say, for a few months or a year or maybe even two, then you can do it. And if you still feel you need help, then find someone who is engaged in this kind of work and ask that person, if you may join him or her for a while. Just in order to turn the corner.</p>

<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t that be a good start?</p>
