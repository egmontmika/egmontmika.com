      <p>I am writing on discipleship, community and mission, basically from two perspectives:</p>
    <p>1) What were the original concepts of discipleship, community and mission that Jesus gave to his first disciples, and what were the practices of the early church?</p>
    <p>2) How can we, in view of common opinions, religious traditions and cultural trends, translate that into our time and world and be genuine and trustworthy followers of Jesus? </p>

        <p>Some people seem never to learn.</p>

<p>They leave their crumbs on the table, put their dirty coffee cup in the sink, spit their chewing gum on top, and just don’t see - and smell - that the trash is overflowing.</p>

<p>Don’t they know any better?</p>

<p>If this were the case, the solution would be to inform them and show them how to finish a coffee break properly.</p>

<p>However, not knowing rarely is the reason. You may call it an attitude. These people just don’t care. Or, let’s say, they don&rsquo;t care for what you care. They just seem to have other preferences.</p>

<p>Do we have to put up with that? Can we change someone’s values or preferences?</p>

<p>Some of us would say, It&rsquo;s impossible, and consider these people hopeless cases. Probably, this would be right if we are expecting the shift to happen on the spot. Pointing a finger, though, seldom changes someone&rsquo;s attitude or preferences and yelling at them won’t accomplish much; at best you will get a hypocrite.</p>

<p>If we want to see real change, we need to address a deeper level of consciousness. We will have to engage and teach and communicate in a way that shares our emotions, insights, values, and beliefs.</p>

<p>Jesus wouldn&rsquo;t call anyone a hopeless case, far less start moralizing. Instead, he would aim at changing the people from the inside. And for a higher purpose than just raising their outward behavior.</p>

<p>He would try to touch their heart.</p>

<p>How do you do that?</p>

        </header>
        <p>&ldquo;In the beginning, God created&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is how the probably most significant story of humanity begins. People have told this story for thousands of years, and it still is passed on from generation to generation.</p>

<p>It’s the story of stories.</p>

<p>This story tells us where we come from and what our purpose is, and it connects us humans globally, across the borders of races, nations, and generations.</p>

<p>It’s the story that tells us who we are.</p>

<p>To fully unfold its beauty and its power, you may want to hear it orally. Just knowing about it or being able to state its content does not give you the full experience. Writing it down or reading it word by word is much better, but still not quite the same as listening to it when being told orally.</p>

<p>To fully experience its power, you also may want to get hold of its unwritten values, beliefs, convictions, and experiences.
You may want to capture its spirit.</p>

<p>Therefore, nothing matches up to listening to someone who tells the story orally and with conviction, who not only knows it by heart but loves it and has incorporated it into his or her own beliefs. Someone who has aligned with its spirit.</p>

<p>Then, the story becomes alive.</p>

<p>Then, this story enables us to transcend beyond our self-imposed differences, peering into a more fundamental realm of our existence, one more intrinsic to our nature than many of our rationalistic attempts to understand what human life is all about.</p>

<p>When we unleash the power of this story, it encourages us to strengthen bonds and build mutual trust.</p>

<p>And work for a shared future.</p>
