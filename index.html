      <p>I am writing on discipleship, community and mission, basically from two perspectives:</p>
    <p>1) What were the original concepts of discipleship, community and mission that Jesus gave to his first disciples, and what were the practices of the early church?</p>
    <p>2) How can we, in view of common opinions, religious traditions and cultural trends, translate that into our time and world and be genuine and trustworthy followers of Jesus? </p>

        <p>Worrying is NOT a virtue.</p>

<p>On the contrary, it’s absolutely destructive. It’s a poison.</p>

<p>Worrying obscures your faith, weakens your strength, takes away your initiative, and quenches your creativity.</p>

<p>It steals your joy.</p>

<p>Worrying breaks you down spiritually, mentally, and physically. And it keeps you from doing your work.</p>

<p>It keeps you from living your life.</p>

<p>It’s easy to make people and circumstances responsible for your worries. Yet, they are not the producers. Worrying starts with a fearful thought in our own mind, with fearing things to get worse or something dreadful to happen. However, these things have not happened yet, and chances are, they will never happen.</p>

<p>Worrying is a product of our mind.</p>

<p>Outside of us, this fearful thought does not even exist, yet, to us it’s real. And by entertaining it, we let it slowly break down our spiritual and mental health, with possible symptoms even in our physical body.</p>

<p>How can we get rid of it? Here are three steps:</p>

<ul>
<li>Take an intentional decision NOT to worry. Just refuse to submit to that thought.</li>
<li>Then, do whatever is possible for you to avoid whatever it is you fear.</li>
<li>Finally, focus on a better and higher goal and trust God that there will be a solution, in case things get worse.</li>
</ul>

<p>Jesus said, Do not worry! Seek first God’s kingdom! He sternly commanded his disciples not to fear and not to worry. Instead, he prompted them to prioritize God&rsquo;s kingdom.</p>

<p>Worrying is worthless. It doesn&rsquo;t change anything for the better.</p>

<p>However, to take action and to trust God is wise.</p>

<p>This is practicing your faith.</p>

        <p>The status quo of the institutionalized church is powerful indeed.</p>

<p>And we try to keep it alive by small improvements here and there, fancier equipment, trendier arrangements, and popular speakers. We add layers, patches, and small improvisations. Try to be modern.</p>

<p>All to save something we don&rsquo;t want to reconsider.</p>

<p>We hardly ever question its basic structure, i. e., the institutional system, including constitutions, elections, offices, fundraising, buildings, and programs. Its division into clergy/professionals and laity.</p>

<p>And its politics.</p>

<p>If we could start all over again and design something that actually would express the Kingdom of Heaven as proclaimed and put into practice by Jesus and the first century communities of disciples, what would we consider?</p>

<p>Here are some suggestions:</p>

<p><strong><em>Purpose</em></strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The mission of Jesus as the church&rsquo;s ultimate purpose, to seek and save the lost. To reconcile them and to teach and train them as disciples, in order to send them out and do the same with others.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Community</em></strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Community, not as an institution, but as a family.</li>
<li>Extended families and their homes as the basic units of the church in a city.</li>
<li>Not the building of a denomination, but the continuous multiplication of disciple communities as a viral movement.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Leadership</em></strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Spirit-filled and Spirit appointed leadership.</li>
<li>The general priesthood of all disciples.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Practice</em></strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The proclamation and demonstration of God’s kingdom in everyday life.</li>
<li>Seeking and saving the lost and training them as disciples on a personal level.</li>
<li>Authoritative preaching and teaching followed by signs.</li>
<li>The working of the gifts of the Spirit.</li>
</ul>

<p>No matter, whether following a more traditional hierarchical or a more democratic system,
institutional churches easily fall into the trap of worldly management and business behavior.</p>

<p>Therefore, let us from time to time consider the original assignment and, whenever there is an opportunity, take the chance to break out of a misguiding system.</p>

<p>And start all over again.</p>
