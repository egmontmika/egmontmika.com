      <p>I am writing on discipleship, community and mission, basically from two perspectives:</p>
    <p>1) What were the original concepts of discipleship, community and mission that Jesus gave to his first disciples, and what were the practices of the early church?</p>
    <p>2) How can we, in view of common opinions, religious traditions and cultural trends, translate that into our time and world and be genuine and trustworthy followers of Jesus? </p>

        <p>&ldquo;In the beginning, God created&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is how the probably most significant story of humanity begins. People have told this story for thousands of years, and it still is passed on from generation to generation.</p>

<p>It’s the story of stories.</p>

<p>This story tells us where we come from and what our purpose is, and it connects us humans globally, across the borders of races, nations, and generations.</p>

<p>It’s the story that tells us who we are.</p>

<p>To fully unfold its beauty and its power, you may want to hear it orally. Just knowing about it or being able to state its content does not give you the full experience. Writing it down or reading it word by word is much better, but still not quite the same as listening to it when being told orally.</p>

<p>To fully experience its power, you also may want to get hold of its unwritten values, beliefs, convictions, and experiences.
You may want to capture its spirit.</p>

<p>Therefore, nothing matches up to listening to someone who tells the story orally and with conviction, who not only knows it by heart but loves it and has incorporated it into his or her own beliefs. Someone who has aligned with its spirit.</p>

<p>Then, the story truly becomes alive.</p>

<p>Then, this story enables us to transcend beyond our self-imposed differences, peering into a more fundamental realm of our existence, one more intrinsic to our nature than many of our rationalistic attempts to understand what human life is all about.</p>

<p>When we unleash the power of this story, it encourages us to strengthen bonds and build mutual trust.</p>

<p>And work for a shared future.</p>

        <p>Bitterness is a killer.</p>

<p>Holding onto accusations hurts you more than anything else. Leaves you with a far greater damage than anything people can do to you. Bitterness steals your peace and breaks you down continuously. It kills you not only emotionally and spiritually, but also physically.</p>

<p>So, what can you do in order to overcome? Here follow three steps:</p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong></p>

<p>The first step is to stop.</p>

<p>Stop meditating on what happened. Stop accusing. Stop seeking revenge. Stop lamenting. Stop feeling sorry for yourself.</p>

<p>Just say, Stop!</p>

<p>Overcoming starts with this decision. Anyone can do it. You can do it, no matter whose guilt it is, no matter what the damage is, and no matter what your feelings are at the moment. Once you take that decision, eventually your feelings will follow.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2</strong></p>

<p>The next step is to forgive.</p>

<p>This is the hardest part. You forgive, although the people who harmed you never regretted what they did, far less apologized. And don&rsquo;t just think, I forgive you, but speak it out loudly so you can hear your own voice. Even better, let also someone else hear it.</p>

<p>Call the person by name and shout it out, I don’t accuse you anymore! I forgive you! You are free!</p>

<p><strong>Step 3</strong></p>

<p>The third step is to admit your own guilt.</p>

<p>Yes, there is guilt with you, as well. In case you cannot think of anything to admit to this other person, at least admit your bitterness. Bitterness is sin. Again, do it loudly and in prayer. And be sure God will hear you and forgive you. He will heal you.</p>

<p>And YOU are free. So precious!</p>
