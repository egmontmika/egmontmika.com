      <p>I am writing on discipleship, community and mission, basically from two perspectives:</p>
    <p>1) What were the original concepts of discipleship, community and mission that Jesus gave to his first disciples, and what were the practices of the early church?</p>
    <p>2) How can we, in view of common opinions, religious traditions and cultural trends, translate that into our time and world and be genuine and trustworthy followers of Jesus? </p>

        <p>You don&rsquo;t have to be a pastor in order to make a disciple of Jesus.</p>

<p>And you don&rsquo;t need to be an apostle or prophet, or an appointed church leader or church planter in order to form a community of disciples.</p>

<p>My wife and I do not hold any of these offices and we never formally “started a church”. In fact, we never attempted to.
However, there has been an informal community of disciples around us ever since we opened up our family and our home and let others join us in our walk with Jesus.</p>

<p>This has been going on for more than 40 years and it still continues: Informal gatherings for meals, worship, bible study, prayer, counselling, working on a project, celebrations, hikes and other outdoor activities, parties, traveling&hellip; and of course, personal mentoring and baptism.</p>

<p>Some of these people have been living with us in our home for a year or two, or just a few months, some of them have been working with us daily.</p>

<p>However, we never had a membership list, appointed leaders, a board of elders, a budget, a constitution, a statement of faith, a list of core values, a mission statement - neither any conflict, splitting, economical problem, or burned out. And we never had any vision other than the one that Jesus gave his disciples.</p>

<p>Probably, most people wouldn&rsquo;t call it a &ldquo;real church”.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, there has been a constant flow of new connections, of teaching and modeling, and a building of community. In Jesus&rsquo; name and under the guidance of his Spirit.</p>

<p>Many of those who have been around us during these years now live in other countries and other continents. With some of them we still are in touch, per email, through social media and through actually visiting each other. Flights are cheap nowadays and make it possible.</p>

<p>This wonderful bunch of people - we may call it community - is both very little and quite large, anything between two or three and nearly a hundred.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s both a local family and a worldwide community. It&rsquo;s well defined by the people who are actually meeting at a certain place and time, but it&rsquo;s also hard to grasp due to its openness and flexibility.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not a brand, an organisation, a building, or an office, yet, it&rsquo;s not just an idea in our heads.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s kept together by Jesus as Lord and by the personal relationships created by him. It&rsquo;s very real and it surely is glorious.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a Jesus community.</p>
