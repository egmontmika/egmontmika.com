      <p>I am writing on discipleship, community and mission, basically from two perspectives:</p>
    <p>1) What were the original concepts of discipleship, community and mission that Jesus gave to his first disciples, and what were the practices of the early church?</p>
    <p>2) How can we, in view of common opinions, religious traditions and cultural trends, translate that into our time and world and be genuine and trustworthy followers of Jesus? </p>

          <h1><a href='http://egmontmika.com/blog/faith-isn%27t-religion/'>Faith Isn&#39;t Religion </a></h1>

        <p>Following Jesus calls for faith. Yet, faith and religion aren’t the same. Faith isn&rsquo;t religion.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t confuse those two!</p>

<p>Typically, religion is made up of two components. There is a set of statements about what a group of people, an organization, a movement, or a society consider to be true. And there are rules, rituals and traditions to follow.</p>

<p>Faith is beyond those things. It’s originated in another realm; it springs forth out of your spirit.</p>

<p>Faith is your trust in God, which includes your genuine actions based on that trust.</p>

<p>Faith is always personal. It&rsquo;s yours, not your parents&rsquo; or anyone else&rsquo;s. And it&rsquo;s never institutional. It’s rooted deep inside of you, generating qualities such as confidence, motivation, vision, courage, mental strength, patience, endurance… Faith is the ultimate motor of your actions.</p>

<p>Religion is great as long as it provides a positive, supporting environment for your faith. At its best, it amplifies your faith.Then, religion may work out for you. However, that’s not always the case. It can also result in the opposite.</p>

<p>Religion can quench your faith.</p>

<p>While faith lets you imagine what could be possible and encourages you to act on that imagination, religion reinforces the status-quo.</p>

<p>Religion makes you fit in, not stand out.</p>

<p>Religion is like a heavy blanket overlaid on top of your faith. As long as you accept its boundaries or don’t ever recognize that it is there, you can feel fine and enjoy whatever it offers.</p>

<p>However, for those who want to take initiative and practice an amount of freedom that is beyond those boundaries, the blanket turns into an iron ceiling, mentally and spiritually.</p>

<p>Once you reach that point,  you have only two options. Adapt to the status quo and let it quench your faith, or leave.</p>

<p>In case you are strong enough to leave, people may wonder, whether you lost your faith. Probably, rather the opposite is true. Stepping out can be the very consequence of your faith. You leave because your faith requires it. What you leave is not your faith, but just a certain temporary religious, social or cultural expression of it.</p>

<p>Leaving, though, is never a convenient step. To others it may even look like a heresy or a betrayal. Or they envy you, but consider the price for themselves too high.</p>

<p>For you, however, that doesn’t matter anymore. For you, it has become a necessity.</p>

<p>The road of discipleship is a rocky road.</p>

<p>And it’s an all but straight and upward leading walk.
If you expected it to just take you from success to success and “from glory to glory”, you’ve probably never really tried it out.</p>

<p>In reality, walking that road doesn’t look that fantastic. Rather, it’s a slow and drawn-out process, much slower and way longer than we would imagine. And a lot messier than we would expect, filled with challenges, setbacks, failures, disappointments and unexpected turns.</p>

<p>Typically, it seems to lead more downward than upward. And whenever you may think you have a grip on it and finally managed to secure some kind of progress, you’ll soon find out that it really wasn’t that much of a success and that you’ll have to start all over again.</p>

<p>The Lord just doesn’t follow any human standards and he has his own ways to evaluate his work and to reach his goals. He always gets there eventually, never too late, yet never too early, and never without first leading you through the deep valleys of setbacks, disappointments and hardship.</p>

<p>It’s his way of refining you. It’s his curriculum for building your faith and training you for a higher cause.</p>

<p>This is why you need to focus on him and trust him alone and not in your abilities or securities, neither let any opinion or circumstance distract or disappoint you.</p>

<p>On the outside, this road may indeed look like leading into failure. However, whatever you see and experience is never the complete truth.</p>

<p>In the middle of a setback, there is still grace for every single step and every minute of your walk. And whatever may happen to you along the way, defeat is never the last word spoken.</p>

<p>In fact, that last word over your life has already been set by Jesus, long before you ever started your journey.</p>

<p>And that word doesn&rsquo;t spell &ldquo;Victory at all times&rdquo;.</p>

<p>But FRUIT !</p>

<p>Thanks, Egmont. You really pointed out many important things. The Lord just doesn&rsquo;t follow any human standards. We should realise that he has his own ways, and follow them. Thanks again.</p>
