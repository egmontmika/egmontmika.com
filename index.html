      <p>I am writing on discipleship, community and mission, basically from two perspectives:</p>
    <p>1) What were the original concepts of discipleship, community and mission that Jesus gave to his first disciples, and what were the practices of the early church?</p>
    <p>2) How can we, in view of common opinions, religious traditions and cultural trends, translate that into our time and world and be genuine and trustworthy followers of Jesus? </p>

        <p>Bitterness is a killer.</p>

<p>Holding onto accusations hurts you more than anything else. Leaves you with a far greater damage than anything people can do to you. Bitterness steals your peace and breaks you down continuously. It kills you not only emotionally and spiritually, but also physically.</p>

<p>So, what can you do in order to overcome? Here follow three steps:</p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong></p>

<p>The first step is to stop.</p>

<p>Stop meditating on what happened. Stop accusing. Stop seeking revenge. Stop lamenting. Stop feeling sorry for yourself.</p>

<p>Just say, Stop!</p>

<p>Overcoming starts with this decision. Anyone can do it. You can do it, no matter whose guilt it is, no matter what the damage is, and no matter what your feelings are at the moment. Once you take that decision, eventually your feelings will follow.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2</strong></p>

<p>The next step is to forgive.</p>

<p>This is the hardest part. You forgive, although the people who harmed you never regretted what they did, far less apologized. And don&rsquo;t just think, I forgive you, but speak it out loudly so you can hear your own voice. Even better, let also someone else hear it.</p>

<p>Call the person by name and shout it out, I don’t accuse you anymore! I forgive you! You are free!</p>

<p><strong>Step 3</strong></p>

<p>The third step is to admit your own guilt.</p>

<p>Yes, there is guilt with you, as well. In case you cannot think of anything to admit to this other person, at least admit your bitterness. Bitterness is sin. Again, do it loudly and in prayer. And be sure God will hear you and forgive you. He will heal you.</p>

<p>And YOU are free. So precious!</p>

        <p>Progress and comfort don’t match.</p>

<p>While not everything that is uncomfortable automatically will give you progress, there will always be a certain amount of inconvenience going along with it.</p>

<p>Performance spikes when we’re doing something out of our norm.</p>

<p>This is not only true for sports but probably for all areas of life, for instance, our spiritual life.</p>

<p>Throughout Scripture, we find that following God’s call and striving for a comfortable life seem to contradict each other. Typically, responding to his call is associated with the requirement of stepping out and leaving. Leaving your family and friends, your familiar environment, and your securities. Changing some of your dear preferences and habits.</p>

<p>Jesus never promised his disciples a comfortable life, yet, he expected them to be ”fruitful”.  For those who wanted to follow him, he pointed out what they could expect: inconveniences, uncertainty, mockery, hatred, and persecution.</p>

<p>Is this too much to expect?</p>

<p>It probably is, but not for those who have made up their minds. They are looking forward to their goal and consider it worthwhile the trouble. They know that hardship makes them achieve more than they ever dreamed possible.</p>

<p>They have learned to take advantage of the uncomfortable.</p>

<p>And they enjoy it.</p>
