      <p>I am writing on discipleship, community and mission, basically from two perspectives:</p>
    <p>1) What were the original concepts of discipleship, community and mission that Jesus gave to his first disciples, and what were the practices of the early church?</p>
    <p>2) How can we, in view of common opinions, religious traditions and cultural trends, translate that into our time and world and be genuine and trustworthy followers of Jesus? </p>

        <p>Church leaders tend to be highly interested in numbers.</p>

<p>Typically, they ask questions like, How many members does the church have, how high is the weekly attendance and how much did the offering bring? And they want to know how these numbers develop from week to week, month to month and year to year?</p>

<p>Admitted, statistics are useful. They enable us to measure and to compare, to set up goals and to stay focussed, and they make us feel successful whenever numbers go up. Numbers seem to show a church’s growth in a reliable, objective way. At least, this is what we tend to think.</p>

<p>Yet, there is a problem.</p>

<p>How can we ever measure essential spiritual qualities like faith and love, fear of the Lord, obedience, maturity and Christlikeness, community and the power of a church’s testimony by counting numbers?</p>

<p>How can we ever find out anything about the quality and the actual spiritual outcome of a church by just measuring quantities?</p>

<p>For instance, does the amount of hours that someone spends participating in church activities say anything about the quality of this person&rsquo;s discipleship? Or can numbers about a church’s widespread popularity and numerical and financial success be translated into significant impact - in terms of fulfilling the church&rsquo;s mission to make disciples?</p>

<p>If spiritual qualities and the actual outcome of the church are not included in our statistics, what do those statistics really say? And what do we accomplish by maximizing these numbers?</p>

<p>In the light of the church’s mission, the ultimate question for a leader and for every follower of Jesus must be, Do we really make disciples of Jesus or are we just having programs? And furthermore, do those who have been discipled, in their part, go on and make disciples? These questions are crucial, as they touch the very nerve of the church&rsquo;s mission.</p>

<p>In this perspective, making a handful of quality disciples may by far outweigh a thousand more names of members or attendees on our lists. After all, disciples are the kind of result that Jesus is expecting. We can&rsquo;t fool him.</p>

<p>Yet, are we possibly fooling ourselves?</p>

        <p>Imagine someone handed you 10.000 USD to spend on whatever you want. The only condition would be that you had to spend it right away, on the same day.</p>

<p>What would you do with the money?</p>

<p>Maybe your mind would go to that fancy computer you had been eying at for a long time. Or that cool hifi-system, or the latest version of your favorite cellphone, or a diving gear for you next dream vacation, or this trendy leather jacket?</p>

<p>Or… ?</p>

<p>Or would you rather spend the money on some event together with other people? Like financing an exotic trip or a beach vacation or a skiing adventure with your spouse or together with all of your family or some friends? Or buying toys for your kids or your grandchildren?</p>

<p>Or could you think of just giving the money away? Like to someone you know who right now is in big trouble and needs financial help? For instance, to a young mother in your neighborhood and her children? Or to a missionary you know? Or to some charity…?</p>

<p>Or…?</p>

<p>No matter what you do, your choice reveals your priorities. For yourself and for others. The ultimate question is:</p>

<p>What is really important to you? And, is it basically stuff or people?</p>

<p>Is it luxury, image, prestige and short time pleasure you are interested in, or is it quality relationships and spiritual values? Will that money basically nurture your ego, or will it help you build community and bless others?</p>

<p>And finally, would its benefit be consumed and burned up within a short time or would it last a little longer? Would it have any significance after ten, twenty or thirty years from now?</p>

<p>In a long time perspective, stuff almost never matters, yet, people do.</p>

<p>People always matter.</p>

<p>Stuff decays, relationships stay. And you can make them grow by investing in them. By giving your time and energy. And your money.</p>

<p>Again, what would <em>you</em> do with the money?</p>
