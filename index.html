      <p>I am writing on discipleship, community and mission, basically from two perspectives:</p>
    <p>1) What were the original concepts of discipleship, community and mission that Jesus gave to his first disciples, and what were the practices of the early church?</p>
    <p>2) How can we, in view of common opinions, religious traditions and cultural trends, translate that into our time and world and be genuine and trustworthy followers of Jesus? </p>

        <p>Jesus called us to make disciples. And making a disciple comes with a price.</p>

<p>It costs you your time, energy, and money. It calls for patience, wisdom and endurance. A long-term commitment.</p>

<p>Now you may wonder: Am I really prepared for this? Is it possible for me to give more time, energy, and money? Am I patient enough, wise enough, and committed enough?</p>

<p>As to time, energy and money, the answer is pretty simple: You already have enough. Weed out those projects and activities that you have given undue importance to. You may want to reevaluate your priorities. That should be possible.</p>

<p>Or, it should be possible for those who really care.</p>

<p>As to patience, endurance, wisdom and commitment, these are a little harder to learn and to improve. Yet, there is no use waiting for it to happen.</p>

<p>You learn these things by doing something that requires practicing those very qualities. Try to find a challenging task. Make a decision and then stick to it, no matter how strong the resistance and no matter how often you fail. You can improve along the way.</p>

<p>Probably, most of us already have one or a few areas where we can get that kind of training. There may be an education that needs to be finished, a project to be completed, a language to be learnt, a book to be written, a house to be renovated…</p>

<p>And why not, a disciple to be made?</p>

<p>So, you can start with your mission right away. Start making a disciple, and then improve along the way.</p>

<p>There is always one first little step you can take, little enough to match your faith and your resources. You can take that step and stick to it. From there, you will know what to do next.</p>

<p>Isn’t this exactly what young parents do? None of us fathers and mothers are really prepared for raising children the day we bring home our first baby. That day we get a kick-start. From there we go on, day by day and night by night and learn patience, endurance, wisdom and improve our commitment along the way.</p>

<p>It’s not always easy to be a parent, and for some of us it’s a real struggle. However, it works out somehow, against all odds, and in spite of all the mistakes we make.</p>

<p>This is what making a disciple is very much alike. It’s costly and it isn’t always easy, yet…</p>

<p>It’s possible for those who really care.</p>

        <p>Paris, November 13th, 2015 !</p>

<p>Overwhelmed and horrified by what happened that night, I asked myself, <em>What is my response to all those terror attacks in recent years, not only in the Middle East and in places “far away”, but also increasingly in Europe?</em></p>

<p>Will the horror stay with me and eventually leave me in a constant state of fear? Will it affect my attitude towards the world and the people around me, towards Muslims in general as well as towards my Muslim friends, colleagues, students and neighbours?</p>

<p>And will it possibly lead me to a reaction that ultimately feeds into a culture of resentment, distrust and fear?</p>

<p>One thing is for sure, if I let fear grip me, then the attacks have accomplished their purpose in me and the terrorists have won the victory!</p>

<p>This shall never happen!</p>

<p>Fortunately, there is another possible response.</p>

<p>‘Eagles of Death Metal’, the band that played at Bataclan that night, made the following statement, issued in <em>The Guardian</em> on November 18th:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Although bonded in grief with the victims, the fans, the families, the citizens of Paris, and all those affected by terrorism, we are proud to stand together, with our new family, now united by a common goal of love and compassion.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This view opens up for a better response and reminds me of the mission we have as followers of Jesus.</p>

<p>You and I may not be able to stop terrorism and solve all the problems connected to it. However, we can remain the masters of our minds and our faith, guard our feelings and attitudes, care for each other, build trust relationships and cultivate community - Muslims included.</p>

<p>Overcoming fear by practicing love and true humanity.</p>

<p>Taking action for a better world.</p>
