      <p>I am writing on discipleship, community and mission, basically from two perspectives:</p>
    <p>1) What were the original concepts of discipleship, community and mission that Jesus gave to his first disciples, and what were the practices of the early church?</p>
    <p>2) How can we, in view of common opinions, religious traditions and cultural trends, translate that into our time and world and be genuine and trustworthy followers of Jesus? </p>

        <p>Are you looking for a thrill? Something really exciting?</p>

<p>You might have been excited when you experienced the Lord for the first time, or when you got baptized in the Spirit and started speaking in tongues, or when you for the first time prayed for someone and this person actually got healed on the spot. Or maybe when you sensed the Lord’s presence during a special worship service… That, if anything, is really exciting! We may call it a thrill.</p>

<p>But now the thrill is gone.</p>

<p>Of course it is.</p>

<p>According to human nature, emotional kicks are temporary; they don&rsquo;t last. That&rsquo;s included in the definition of a thrill.</p>

<p>Repeating the same thing over and over again just isn’t that much of a thrill. You may love your work, but it probably doesn’t give you a kick every time you open the door to your office. Not like the day you entered it for the first time.</p>

<p>So, if you are looking for excitement, you will have to find a fresh experience. And after that you’ll need another one, and then still another, again and again. And every time you seem to get satisfied, yet, the feeling just lasts for a little while.</p>

<p>At times, the life of a disciple of Jesus can be extraordinarily exciting, indeed. Yet, a disciple&rsquo;s life is not at all about chasing excitements, not even spiritual ones.</p>

<p>Rather, it is to faithfully continue the journey you set out on some time ago. You see the needs around you here and now with open eyes, listen to the Lord and do whatever is required. You make the necessary changes in your own life and lead others along that same path.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a long time commitment, and it is put into practice day by day. Changing the world through thousands of small, persistent steps to the better. Joyfully overcoming the resistance from within you and from the outside. Making a difference.</p>

<p>Doing something that matters!</p>

<p>Exciting is fine, yet, mattering is way more important. And still more exciting than a thrill.</p>

<p>Also in the long run.</p>

        <p>In Sweden, summer has arrived and it’s time to take a break.</p>

<p>For Åsa and me, this means to close down all of our regular activities and, except eating and sleeping, do other things than we usually do.</p>

<p>That’s what we call ”to rest”.</p>

<p>Like traveling both short and long distances to visit friends and relatives, staying for a while in Munich, my home city, hiking in the Alps and, last not least, discovering new places. This year, it’s going to be the lovely coast of Southern Croatia with world heritage Dubrovnik as our base.</p>

<p>Summer also means no blogging for a while, let’s say, until the end of August.</p>

<p>You can  still reach us, though, by mail or phone. And  you can still make an appointment, in case you would like to meet us in person.</p>

<p>Finally, I would like to ask you for a favor. Please, would you help me evaluate my writing and make a decision concerning how to go on after the summer? You can do this by sending me a little comment. In case you don’t feel like writing a lot or don’t have the time or think that your English isn’t good enough, I allow you to keep it very short. Just write one single word into the comment box below.</p>

<p>Write either YES or NO.</p>

<p>If you write YES, this will encourage me to go on writing in about the same way as I have done so far, while your NO will encourage me to quit.</p>

<p>Thank you so much for your response.</p>

<p>Have a nice summer! Hopefully, you will hear from me again at the end of August.</p>

<p>Yours,</p>

<p>Egmont</p>
