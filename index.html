      <p>I am writing on discipleship, community and mission, basically from two perspectives:</p>
    <p>1) What were the original concepts of discipleship, community and mission that Jesus gave to his first disciples, and what were the practices of the early church?</p>
    <p>2) How can we, in view of common opinions, religious traditions and cultural trends, translate that into our time and world and be genuine and trustworthy followers of Jesus? </p>

        <p>Nobody likes failures.</p>

<p>However, failures are more precious than most of us are inclined to think.</p>

<p>In fact, they can become stepping stones towards our final success. Don’t get me wrong, a failure really is a failure, not a success. It&rsquo;s ugly, discouraging, accusing, threatening, judging! However&hellip;</p>

<p>A failure doesn&rsquo;t have to be the final word spoken. The crucial question is, what do you do with it? What comes next?</p>

<p>Think of Thomas Edison. Holding as many as 1093 patents in the United States, and in addition many patents in the United Kingdom, France, and Germany, he probably was one of the most prolific inventors of all times. Edison became famous not only for the widespread impact of his inventions, but also for his unbroken decisiveness to never give up. It is said that before succeeding with his first well-functioning light bulb in 1879, he went through around 2000 failures. When during the time of his endless struggles being asked, why he wouldn’t give up such a meaningless endeavor, he gave his well-known answer. ”It’s not a failure at all”, he said, ”I just found 2000 ways of how not to make a light bulb”.</p>

<p>Inventions are made when someone thinks outside the box and tries to accomplish something that others call impossible, or at least meaningless, and uses every failure as a stepping stone for still another try.</p>

<p>However, our problem is that we are stuck inside the box and all we can do is think inside.</p>

<p>So, how do you manage to think on the outside? What then makes individuals finally free themselves from the bonds of the well-known and secure paths of thought, risk a failure and jump the leap? How do you accomplish such a feat?</p>

<p>Many times, it’s through a deep crisis caused by a failure. Sometimes, it’s out of pure desperation. You are stuck and can&rsquo;t see any way out. You hit the bottom and have nothing to lose.</p>

<p>This is when you are ready to stretch beyond what seems possible.</p>

<p>Seen that way, failures are the condition in which creativity is ignited. They are the soil out of which success springs forth, but only for those who stop mourning and lamenting and decide to try again and go on.</p>

<p>Judas didn’t have to end up in a tragedy. That was his own decision, his own self-made judgement. As Jesus restored Peter, I am sure he was ready to even forgive Judas and open up a new life for him, a life of peace and freedom way beyond his failure.</p>

<p>So how do you think about your recent failure? What’s your decision? Are you ready to welcome and embrace it and learn from it?</p>

<p>And open a new and unexpected door.</p>

<p><strong>Comments</strong></p>

<p><em>Geoffrey:</em>  Thank you Egmont! This is true and I have been in failures many times, and I have seen the hand of God in the end of it. The worst part was when I was laughed at, but I was deeply convicted that God my heavenly father will turn it up for his glory. Thanks again.</p>

<p><em>Reply:</em> Thank you, Geoff! You are right. The Lord is a master of turning things round. We just need to wait.</p>

          <h1><a href='http://egmontmika.com/blog/full-time%20or%20part-time/'>Full-Time, Part-Time or Spare-Time Ministry?</a></h1>
          <p><time>2015/09/30</time>&nbsp;&nbsp;400 words</p>

        <p>As a disciple of Jesus, do you have a full-time or a part-time ministry?</p>

<p>Or is yours &ldquo;only&rdquo; spare-time?</p>

<p>No matter what your answer is, following Jesus is neither one. If you are his disciple, you are what you are twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. That’s neither full-time nor part-time nor spare-time.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s <em>all-the-time!</em></p>

<p>The reason for that? Discipleship isn’t based on a service, a duty or a program. It&rsquo;s neither an employment nor a hobby.</p>

<p>Discipleship is a relationship - your relationship with Jesus. And as his disciple you are a child of God; that’s a position, and again a relationship. Everything you do is done within that relationship and can be seen as an expression of it.</p>

<p>On the other hand, churches and denominations offer employments, full-time or part-time. And they engage volunteers in their spare-time.</p>

<p>All these workers have their specific responsibilities and duties. They follow the instructions, meet people&rsquo;s needs, and try to make everyone happy.</p>

<p>On top of that, they probably have an idea of listening to the Lord and try to follow him.</p>

<p>Doing both of these doesn&rsquo;t always work out so well. Following Jesus and fulfilling the requirements for an employee or volunteer aren’t automatically the same.</p>

<p>Following Jesus isn&rsquo;t the same as building an organization or pleasing the people around you. If it works out for you, that&rsquo;s fine. As long as it lasts.</p>

<p>At worst, you may feel like having to serve two masters, which can lead to conflict, frustration and stress, and sometimes even burn-out.</p>

<p>Jesus worked hard, yet never seemed to get any of these symptoms. Is it, because he only served one master and never submitted to people’s expectations?</p>

<p>Thus, he was free to wholeheartedly listen to the Spirit and obey the One who had sent him.</p>

<p>Any-time. All-the-time.</p>
