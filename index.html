      <p>I am writing on discipleship, community and mission, basically from two perspectives:</p>
    <p>1) What were the original concepts of discipleship, community and mission that Jesus gave to his first disciples, and what were the practices of the early church?</p>
    <p>2) How can we, in view of common opinions, religious traditions and cultural trends, translate that into our time and world and be genuine and trustworthy followers of Jesus? </p>

<p>The road of discipleship is a rocky road.</p>

<p>And it’s an all but straight and upward leading walk.
If you expected it to just take you from success to success and “from glory to glory”, you’ve probably never really tried it out.</p>

<p>In reality, walking that road doesn’t look that fantastic. Rather, it’s a slow and drawn-out process, much slower and way longer than we would imagine. And a lot messier than we would expect, filled with challenges, setbacks, failures, disappointments and unexpected turns.</p>

<p>Typically, it seems to lead more downward than upward. And whenever you may think you have a grip on it and finally managed to secure some kind of progress, you’ll soon find out that it really wasn’t that much of a success and that you’ll have to start all over again.</p>

<p>The Lord just doesn’t follow any human standards and he has his own ways to evaluate his work and to reach his goals. He always gets there eventually, never too late, yet never too early, and never without first leading you through the deep valleys of setbacks, disappointments and hardship.</p>

<p>It’s his way of refining you. It’s his curriculum for building your faith and training you for a higher cause.</p>

<p>This is why you need to focus on him and trust him alone and not in your abilities or securities, neither let any opinion or circumstance distract or disappoint you.</p>

<p>On the outside, this road may indeed look like leading into failure. However, whatever you see and experience is never the complete truth.</p>

<p>In the middle of a setback, there is still grace for every single step and every minute of your walk. And whatever may happen to you along the way, defeat is never the last word spoken.</p>

<p>In fact, that last word over your life has already been set by Jesus, long before you ever started your journey.</p>

<p>And that word doesn&rsquo;t spell &ldquo;Victory at all times&rdquo;.</p>

<p>But &ldquo;Fruit that lasts&rdquo;!</p>

<p>Thanks, Egmont. You really pointed out many important things. The Lord just doesn&rsquo;t follow any human standards. We should realise that he has his own ways, and follow them. Thanks again.</p>

<p>Don’t work <em>for</em> the Lord! Work <em>with</em> him!</p>

<p>Why are there so many discouraged and burned-out pastors? Why do so many leave the ministry? Didn’t Jesus say that his burden would be light?</p>

<p>Maybe ministry has become too heavy, because too much has been added by man. Too much of human ambitions and desires to influence and accomplish and control. Too much of duties, worries and fear.</p>

<p>Jesus simply expects us to follow him and make disciples. Then, naturally, we take care of each other as a family.</p>

<p>This is not a problem, as long as there is no position to achieve or to keep. And no other obligations and expectations that come along with it are stealing your focus.</p>

<p>Without position, you can do as little or as much as you are able to, or have faith for, or think that you can afford. In this way, your burden is self-regulating. It never grows beyond your ability and your faith. Still, it can grow, slowly enough to enable you to grow along with it.</p>

<p>I don’t think we need to make up a great vision or strategy or plan, just because this is what all the leadership books tell us and what every great church seems to have. It&rsquo;s just a guessing anyway. And a burden. Or even a curse.</p>

<p>And we don’t need to prove our spirituality or ability as a leader to anyone, neither to ourselves. The Lord leads by his Spirit and defines what success is, and he alone is to be honoured.</p>

<p>So, don’t worry.</p>

<p>Don’t worry about &ldquo;your ministry&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s not yours anyway, but Jesus&rsquo;. And don&rsquo;t submit to wrong expectations from others. Instead, find out what the Lord already has prepared for you.</p>

<p>And join in WITH him!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Are you a pastor or a church leader? The stress doesn&rsquo;t come from position. It comes from people who have messages from God, who call all hours every day asking for guidance, from different institutions demanding papers and other documents for everything you as a church do. It comes from making constant decisions. It comes from good meaning folks who think you should do this or that. It comes from people trying to take control of the vision God has given to you and go a direction u know is not what God has for your church.</p>

<p>Thank you, Dan, for your comment. You are right that position in itself would not be a problem, but the things you mention are the very things that come along with position.</p>
