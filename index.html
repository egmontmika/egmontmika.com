      <p>I am writing on discipleship, community and mission, basically from two perspectives:</p>
    <p>1) What were the original concepts of discipleship, community and mission that Jesus gave to his first disciples, and what were the practices of the early church?</p>
    <p>2) How can we, in view of common opinions, religious traditions and cultural trends, translate that into our time and world and be genuine and trustworthy followers of Jesus? </p>

        <p>When you pray, who does most of the talking?</p>

<p>You or the Lord?</p>

<p>Your answer will depend on where your focus is. Whether it is on yourself and your problems and desires, or on Him and His concerns.</p>

<p>On your ways or on His.</p>

<p>Depending on your focus you mostly either talk or listen.</p>

<p>God is looking for people who are eager to listen.</p>

<p>He wants you to hear what He has to say and what He wants to do. He wants you to learn from Him and connect with His plans and His purposes.</p>

<p>And become part of His ways.</p>

<p>People who listen have switched their focus from ”I” and ”me” to ”You” and ”Your”.</p>

<p>This changes your prayer radically.</p>

<p>Now you see your own life and everyone around you in a new light. In His light. You look at them from His point of view, and you see what He is about to do and your part in it.</p>

<p>As a result, your long prayer talks will get shorter and shorter and will finally be reduced to a minimum, while the time you spend listening to Him will extend all the more.</p>

<p>When listening, God’s ways become yours.</p>

<p>And your ways become His.</p>

        <p>It&rsquo;s not a bad thing to be controversial.</p>

<p>And it’s absolutely no sin.</p>

<p>Anyone who stands up for what is right will meet opposition. The higher your position, the worse it can get. The stronger the rejection and the more disastrous the possible consequences.</p>

<p>The higher your purpose, the higher the cost.</p>

<p>With this in mind, it seems an easier way to adapt, to conform and be nice, trying to please as many as possible. Follow the public opinion, stay politically correct and socially accepted.</p>

<p>Sadly, this is where spiritual movements tend to end. After an initial period of radical commitment, many times ridiculed, despised and hated by its contemporaries, a movement slowly adapts and finally becomes well respected.</p>

<p>This has been the weakness of mainstream Christianity throughout the centuries. And it still is.</p>

<p>“When the salt loses its saltiness it’s not good for anything.”</p>

<p>Not so Jesus. Jesus was controversial. And he still is.</p>

<p>He never bowed under the pressure from his surroundings. Rather than calming down and taking it safe, he kept challenging his opponents to the uttermost.</p>

<p>He was able to stand up against the storm because he was willing to pay the price.</p>

<p>And he finally did.</p>

<p>As his followers, we need to be prepared for being controversial. Being controversial for a high goal can actually be a very good thing. Facing opposition helps you clarify your purpose, sharpen your focus and strengthen your will.</p>

<p>Shows what you go for.</p>

<p>For some of us, being controversial is more than something to suffer.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a necessity.</p>
