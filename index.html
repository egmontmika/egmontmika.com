      <p>I am writing on discipleship, community and mission, basically from two perspectives:</p>
    <p>1) What were the original concepts of discipleship, community and mission that Jesus gave to his first disciples, and what were the practices of the early church?</p>
    <p>2) How can we, in view of common opinions, religious traditions and cultural trends, translate that into our time and world and be genuine and trustworthy followers of Jesus? </p>

        <p><em>”I want patience, and I want it right NOW!!!”</em></p>

<p>The more you yell, the more you’ll miss it.</p>

<p>No one is born with patience, in fact, the opposite is true. And there is no short-cut to get it. No button to push, no recipe to follow, no course to attend. It’s nothing money can buy…</p>

<p>Patience is learned the hard way. Over time, and through suffering.</p>

<p>By suffering the pain of waiting.</p>

<p>God doesn’t seem to have a problem with it. He is the Master of patience. He can wait. For days and weeks and months and years, and if necessary, a few thousand of them.</p>

<p>Patience is so much part of his character that we can’t even think of him as not being patient. Being patient with <em>us</em>, of course!</p>

<p>We like that idea, yet, it’s not the end of the story. Even in this respect, he wants us to become more like him, share his godly character, and produce some good fruit.</p>

<p>So, if this is his will for you and me, and if this is what we really want, why don’t we go for it?</p>

<p>Welcome every opportunity to train patience and get a little closer to our goal. Or even look out for these opportunities and rejoice whenever we find one.</p>

<p>Every day you can simply find some situation that makes you wait.</p>

<p>And then train yourself in the godly character of being patient. Suffer a little with that purpose in mind…</p>

<p>And enjoy it!</p>

        <p>Simplicity isn’t the same as poverty. Poverty is a curse, simplicity is an accomplishment.</p>

<p>The accomplishment of the wise.</p>

<p>Simplicity is obtainable. Everyone can achieve it, but not everyone will.</p>

<p>When you turn around and start following Jesus, many things will turn simpler for you.</p>

<p>This doesn’t mean that you flee from the complexity of life. Rather, you face and embrace it, and then simplify by making active choices.</p>

<p>You structure your hours and plan your activities in order to follow your calling and accomplish an aim. You bring your will in line with that aim, and faithfully and diligently stick to your decisions.</p>

<p>This changes your life and simplifies it.</p>

<p>You’ll know what time to get up and what time to go to bed. You’ll know what to engage in and what to exclude. You’ll know what kind of food you feed yourself with, even mentally and spiritually, what you want to read, listen to and look at.</p>

<p>And you consciously keep away from distractions. You practice mental hygiene.</p>

<p>Most of all, you’ll change your attitude. You’ll take away your pride, insecurities and self-concerns, opening your view for the needs of others. That will save you from a lot of self-made problems. It simplifies it!</p>

<p>Up to your turning point, you allow distractions to fill your life. You don’t want to miss anything. Your days can be filled to the bursting point, but leave you heartbreakingly empty.</p>

<p>After that turning point, this will be fundamentally different.</p>

<p>Now, your life is filled with a purpose and you are on your way. You can afford to miss a thousand things without loosing anything.</p>

<p>And stay simple!</p>
