      <p>I am writing on discipleship, community and mission, basically from two perspectives:</p>
    <p>1) What were the original concepts of discipleship, community and mission that Jesus gave to his first disciples, and what were the practices of the early church?</p>
    <p>2) How can we, in view of common opinions, religious traditions and cultural trends, translate that into our time and world and be genuine and trustworthy followers of Jesus? </p>

        <p><strong><em>Definition</em></strong></p>

<p>When Jesus commanded his disciples to go out and make disciples, they understood this as building a <strong><em>master-disciple</em></strong> relationship. The apostle Paul translated it into his greco-roman world by instead talking about a <strong><em>father-son</em></strong> relationship. Today, we often use the term <strong><em>mentorship</em></strong>. Still, it&rsquo;s the same content, the same mission. It&rsquo;s the mission that Jesus gave us.This is how I use this term in my blog.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Mentorship - Respect, Freedom and Trust</strong></p>

<p>Mentorship requires trust.</p>

<p>And trust presupposes respect and freedom.</p>

<p>For a mentor this means respecting another person’s background and personality, her opinion, taste, religion, or whatever she brings along. Also her negative sides. It’s possible to show respect without necessarily agreeing.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it means respecting that person’s decisions.  Granting her the freedom to live her life and follow her own preferences. This includes the freedom to say “yes” or “no” to Jesus, and  also to you as her mentor.</p>

<p>Respect and freedom - these are the preconditions, but finally it’s all about trust.</p>

<p>Trust is a relationship. You can’t buy it, neither do you get it by begging or arguing or manipulating. And you never build trust by engaging someone in your projects, thus “using” her for your own purposes. There is no such way.</p>

<p>Trust grows gradually&hellip; You’ll have to build it, patiently and carefully through consistency in action, thought and motives.</p>

<p>Trust needs to be cultivated, not managed. There is a world of difference between those two.</p>

<p>Respect, freedom and trust - you can see them in Jesus’ way of meeting people, as three expressions of his love.</p>

<p>As his disciples and communicators of that love,  we can never depart from those three. If we ignore any of them, we lose our mentor relationship.</p>

<p>Therefore, acting Jesus-like means in this context:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Showing respect, even when disrespected</p></li>

<li><p>Granting freedom,  even when controlled, manipulated or threatened.</p></li>

<li><p>Building trust, even when undeserved.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>You can start out with any acquaintance, on any level of relationship. Sometimes, though, you&rsquo;ll have to start from scratch. It isn’t always easy.  People aren’t easy. For you as a mentor, it’s an investment into another person’s life. An investment of your love, time and energy, although with no guarantees.</p>

<p>However when successful, it’s an investment that produces good fruit.</p>

<p>All the way to eternity.</p>

        <p>Give to the Lord what he is asking you for!</p>

<p>No one is born as a disciple of Jesus, far less a disciple maker. Yet, this is what Jesus wants us to be, a disciple and a disciple maker.</p>

<p>Accordingly, somewhere along the road, there must be a turning point, or a new start. For every one of us.</p>

<p>We may argue that we are not gifted like evangelist so and so or pastor so and so…, but that’s not the point! They do it their way, and we are asked to do it our way. There is no one else on the planet who can do it just like you and me, and fill the place that only you and I can fill.</p>

<p>If we don’t show up, the Kingdom will lack some important and unique workers.</p>

<p>We may say that we are decent and regular church goers. We have attended hundreds or even thousands of worship services, dozens of bible studies and we are supporting one or several ministries.</p>

<p>That’s all quite impressive and good&hellip; however, being a disciple and making a disciple has little to do with all this. Why did Jesus in his great commission not even mention all these things that today form our Christian culture and keep us busy, week after week?</p>

<p>The question then to ask is: What are we doing? Are we disciple makers?</p>

<p>And by that I am not referring to the success we have achieved&hellip;. we must leave that part up to the Lord. All we need to worry about is: whether we are engaging in such a task or not?</p>

<p>I trust this summer vacation will give us time to reflect on this question.</p>

<p>Discipleship is not a selfish act. It’s a service to the world and to every human soul. We can’t cheat the Lord. But let us not cheat ourselves. And let us also not cheat humanity of our contribution. Instead, let us give each other and the world what we’ve got.</p>

<p>And to the Lord what he is asking us for!</p>
