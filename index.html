      <p>I am writing on discipleship, community and mission, basically from two perspectives:</p>
    <p>1) What were the original concepts of discipleship, community and mission that Jesus gave to his first disciples, and what were the practices of the early church?</p>
    <p>2) How can we, in view of common opinions, religious traditions and cultural trends, translate that into our time and world and be genuine and trustworthy followers of Jesus? </p>

        <p>Great ideas are fun!</p>

<p>Great ideas sound good and make you feel good. Great ideas always find their listeners.</p>

<p>However, an idea is quite irrelevant as long as it isn’t tested.</p>

<p>The testing makes all the difference. It separates the achiever from the mere dreamer. The testing is the real hard part.</p>

<p>Probably, one thing the testing shows is that your great idea isn’t really that great. Others had the same idea before you and didn’t find it worth the trouble to make it work out. Or they gave it some tries and failed. You should know about that, before you start working and investing your time and energy.</p>

<p>This requires honesty, good judgement and decidedness.</p>

<p>Secondly, the testing probably shows that your great idea will not be accomplished as easily and fast as you thought. You’ll have to admit that before you can make a long-term plan and prepare yourself for the process that is required.</p>

<p>On top of honesty, good judgement and decidedness, this requires patience and persistence.</p>

<p>Moreover, the testing will probably show that you are not as smart as you thought. You’ll have to admit even that, before you are willing to learn more, understand more, develop some more skills and start asking for help.</p>

<p>This requires humility and dedication.</p>

<p>Finally, the testing will possibly show that your great idea doesn’t work out the way you thought. At this point, your idea may look like a failure.</p>

<p>After this insight, your real work begins.</p>

<p>From now on, your idea requires faith.</p>

<p>The world doesn’t need more people announcing a thousand bright ideas. What we need is someone who is willing to stick to one idea and test it, develop it, and refine it, and never give up - until it works.</p>

<p>Alas! You can preach as much as you want, yet, making a disciple for Jesus is quite a different story!</p>

        <p>If you are hungry, half a hamburger is better than nothing.</p>

<p>If you need  to finance a project, raising only half of the money is better than no money at all.
If you’re expecting a thousand people to read your article and only five hundred actually read it, this is still better than none.</p>

<p>Many times, half is better than nothing. But not always. What about half a promise?</p>

<ul>
<li>If you ask a baby sitter to come over…</li>
<li>If you invite friends for dinner…</li>
<li>If you need a partner for your project…</li>
<li>If you want to marry…</li>
</ul>

<p>…and the answer you get never surpasses a ”maybe”, I would call this giving half a promise.</p>

<p>Half a promise can be worse than no promise.</p>

<p>With a ”no”, you still had the choice of asking someone else, but with a ”maybe” you are stuck. You don’t get anywhere, and things can get even worse. Like, when &ldquo;promising&rdquo; a beach vacation to your family, or &ldquo;agreeing&rdquo; to engage in a project, or &ldquo;promising&rdquo; a life-long marriage - and never getting beyond a &ldquo;maybe&rdquo;&hellip;</p>

<p>In these cases, half a promise can end in a sheer disaster for you and for whoever partners with you.</p>

<p>The same is true for our decision to follow Jesus. He expects us to give him a clear ”yes” or ”no”, not a ”maybe”.</p>

<p>And pretending would be even worse than that.</p>

<p>It’s good for you and me to make up our minds and know what we want and what we don’t want to engage in. And it’s a blessing for everyone around us when we are able give them a clear ”yes” or ”no”.</p>

<p>If you can’t give a wholehearted promise, it’s probably better not to give any.</p>
