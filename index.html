      <p>I am writing on discipleship, community and mission, basically from two perspectives:</p>
    <p>1) What were the original concepts of discipleship, community and mission that Jesus gave to his first disciples, and what were the practices of the early church?</p>
    <p>2) How can we, in view of common opinions, religious traditions and cultural trends, translate that into our time and world and be genuine and trustworthy followers of Jesus? </p>

        <p>Church isn&rsquo;t the same as a worship service.</p>

<p>Nothing you <strong><em>go to</em></strong>.</p>

<p>Neither a program nor an event. Far less a building, an organisation or a denomination. It wasn&rsquo;t that from the beginning, and it still isn&rsquo;t meant to be that today.</p>

<p>What is it, then?</p>

<p>It’s a family, a movement, a divine fellowship. A calling and a mission.</p>

<p>It’s what we are born into as followers of Jesus, redeemed through him, reconciled with our Father in heaven.</p>

<p>By his grace.</p>

<p><a href="https://molongnacua.com/being-church/?blogsub=confirmed#blog_subscription-3">Molong Nacua</a>, a Jesus follower from the Filipines, put it this way:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Church is where Christ lives, not the place where we meet. It is Christ-empowered people, a kingdom of priests for the purpose of winning against the works of the devil and establishing God&rsquo;s Kingdom.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s about who we <strong><em>are</em></strong>. In Christ. Then follow him. Listen and obey. No matter where, no matter when - everywhere, at all times.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t <strong><em>go to</em></strong> church. <strong><em>Be</em></strong> church.</p>

        <p>Some are late comers by habit.</p>

<p>To them, it seems all right to always show up &ldquo;just a little late&rdquo;. Nobody will take notice anyway, it seems. And others will be late as well, they think.</p>

<p>To them, coming late is all right, as long as they don’t miss the highlights and as long as they get what they are expecting. And fulfill their social duty to show up.</p>

<p>Why invest more time than necessary?</p>

<p>In contrast, others may always want to come a little earlier. Be there before the program starts. Offering a little extra time. Just for being mentally prepared. Or for encouraging the host. Or for making themselves available. Like being able to lend a helping hand for the last preparations.</p>

<p>Or for chatting with another early comer. Encourage someone who came with a need, with the desire to meet someone who would listen.</p>

<p>Coming a little earlier gives you time to connect. Time to build a relationship. Time to care.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s precious time!</p>

<p>You may not want to miss it.</p>
