      <p>I am writing on discipleship, community and mission, basically from two perspectives:</p>
    <p>1) What were the original concepts of discipleship, community and mission that Jesus gave to his first disciples, and what were the practices of the early church?</p>
    <p>2) How can we, in view of common opinions, religious traditions and cultural trends, translate that into our time and world and be genuine and trustworthy followers of Jesus? </p>

          <p><time>2017/04/26</time>&nbsp;&nbsp;300 words</p>
        </header>
        <p>You can hear an inspiring message. You can read a life-changing book.
You can get overwhelmed by a new insight.</p>

<p>Yet, see nothing change.</p>

<p>For most of us, consuming such content just isn’t strong enough
to break through the habits and mental strongholds that we have built up over time.
Not strong enough to overcome our desire for comfort and to crack our fear.
We rather hold on to a lousy status-quo that makes us feel safe than take a step into the unknown.</p>

<p>This is why a personal crisis can work as a door opener, but only if it
is stronger than our desire for comfort and stronger than our fear.</p>

<p>In order to move forward, good insights are just not good enough.
Probably we also need, from time to time, a period of destabilisation. That is, a real good crisis.</p>

<p>The secret of success is to accept the crisis and make it your friend. Take
 advantage of the insecurity that comes along with it, collect your strength and intentionally work for a break-through. This is the time to do it. Not waiting for the storm to calm down neither looking behind, but focussing on the future with decisiveness.</p>

<p>For moving into a better future, a crisis can be inestimably valuable. Don&rsquo;t let it become a stumbling block.</p>

<p>Instead, make it a stepping stone.</p>

        <p>It&rsquo;s never too late to invest in the future.</p>

<p>The best time to plant a tree was twenty years ago, it is said.
Yet, the second best time is now.</p>

<p>It’s never too late to plant a tree.</p>

<p>No matter how old you are, today you can start an education, start learning a language, start changeing a habit, start building a house, start a project&hellip;</p>

<p>Today you can invest in your future. And in others&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Our lives are far more significant than we tend to think at the moment. Every single one of us is the center of a sphere of influence. And we are reaching out, not only to the people around us during our own life time, but also to those who come after us.</p>

<p>They may not know who was the planter, yet they enjoy your tree and its fruit. And they may not always know who built that house or who started that project. Yet, they still enjoy its benefits.</p>

<p>Today you can invest.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s never too late.</p>
