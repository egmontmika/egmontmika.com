      <p>I am writing on discipleship, community and mission, basically from two perspectives:</p>
    <p>1) What were the original concepts of discipleship, community and mission that Jesus gave to his first disciples, and what were the practices of the early church?</p>
    <p>2) How can we, in view of common opinions, religious traditions and cultural trends, translate that into our time and world and be genuine and trustworthy followers of Jesus? </p>

        <p>There are certain things I absolutely don’t feel happy to talk about.</p>

<p>Like telling another person how I made a fool of myself, or the number of times I reacted immaturely or arrogantly. Nor do I want to speak about the time I yelled and screamed and just couldn’t control my anger. But why should I?</p>

<p>Why should I expose myself and admit my failures? Why bother others with my private stuff?</p>

<p>The problem is that others have seen it, and that’s embarrassing enough. Or in case nobody did, at least I know about it and feel ashamed. And of course, the Lord knows it…</p>

<p>Is there a way out?</p>

<p>Yes, there is. I’ll have to talk about it.</p>

<p>Admitted, not everybody needs to know all my filth, and probably it wouldn’t be of any public interest, anyway.</p>

<p>However, if this thing is still bothering me, I need to talk about it.</p>

<p>I need to take a deep breath and talk to someone I trust. And contact the person I offended or let down or betrayed, not in order to explain, but to admit, regret and apologize. Then, give myself a new start.</p>

<p>This can completely change my situation. It’s like opening a window and letting fresh air flood into my room.</p>

<p>Are you in that situation?</p>

<p>Then, may I suggest that you talk about it. It isn’t always easy, yet it&rsquo;s worth it.</p>

<p>You won&rsquo;t regret it!</p>

          <h1><a href='http://egmontmika.com/blog/ranking-jesus-words'>Ranking Jesus&#39; Words</a></h1>
          <p><time>2015/01/22</time>&nbsp;&nbsp;300 words</p>
        </header>
        <p>Jesus said: “Go and make disciples!” As a disciple of Jesus, how do those words rank on your list?</p>

<p>When you think of your work, your spare time, your daily routines, and weekly obligations, including your spiritual engagements and church activities, where on that list would you place your response to Jesus’ words about making disciples?</p>

<p>Maybe you have already made some disciples, or just one, or maybe none. Or maybe you are just about to make one, or planning to. Or have tried and given up, or never tried, but would like to.</p>

<p>Sometimes our routines, habits and obligations crowd out the most important things in life. And most often our church culture with all its programs, activities and obligations keeps us from caring enough for another person and from taking the time, the effort and the sacrifice that it takes to make a disciple.</p>

<p>Yet, whom shall we blame?</p>

<p>No matter how glorious or how lousy you and I may feel about it, this is a new year and today is a new day and along with it comes the freedom for a new decision and a new start. It’s up to you and me how we respond to Jesus.</p>

<p>Disciple making isn’t easy for anyone.</p>

<p>Yet, it’s possible for those who rank it high on their list.</p>
