      <p>I am writing on discipleship, community and mission, basically from two perspectives:</p>
    <p>1) What were the original concepts of discipleship, community and mission that Jesus gave to his first disciples, and what were the practices of the early church?</p>
    <p>2) How can we, in view of common opinions, religious traditions and cultural trends, translate that into our time and world and be genuine and trustworthy followers of Jesus? </p>

        <p>Having failed isn&rsquo;t the same as feeling like a failure.</p>

<p>That feeling can be much worse.</p>

<p>A failure in itself is just an event, not a feeling. It&rsquo;s something specific that happened to you at a specific time in a specific place. Like you didn’t pass the test, couldn’t keep your promise, missed your flight, lost your credit card, gave a foolish comment.</p>

<p>A failure can be dealt with successfully in basically three ways&hellip;</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You can repair the damage. There is no use of lamenting over spilled milk. You know what to do and just do it. A simple excuse can be added; that&rsquo;s good enough.</p></li>

<li><p>You can’t repair the damage, but learn from it. Notorious late comers can actually stop blaming the circumstances and instead admit their failure, go to the bottom with that problem and take practical steps to change their habit.</p></li>

<li><p>You can ignore it. If you just missed an opportunity, that’s it. Nothing more to think about. No use to grieve. It may challenge you emotionally and you may have to pay a price, but so what? You just leave it behind and go on.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>It’s not always easy to handle a failure, but most failures can be dealt with in a rational way.</p>

<p>It’s much harder to cope with feelings. Feelings are irrational.</p>

<p>Feeling like a failure has very little to do with actually failing. You can fail a thousand times without necessarily feeling like a failure. On the other hand, you can feel like a failure in the face of obvious success.</p>

<p>Feeling like a failure isn’t based on what happened, but on our thinking. On the story we tell ourselves or what others tell us about ourselves. Such a story works like a prophesy. Once you believe it you will try to prove it and find evidence for it. For sure, you will always find what you are looking for.</p>

<p>So if you want to feel discriminated, neglected, looked down at, hated or felt sorry for - no problem. Just keep focusing on that thought and you’ll get the feeling.</p>

<p>However, if you want to protect yourself and stop feeling like a failure, there are a few essential steps you can take:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Stop meditating on your false story. Throw it out of your mind and refuse to let it settle there again, whenever those thoughts show up. Remember that you are the master of your mind.</p></li>

<li><p>Stop engaging with the false assumption that in order to stop feeling like a failure you’ll have to succeed. You don&rsquo;t. You can get rid of that feeling without a single success.</p></li>

<li><p>Instead, start meditating on another story, based on the story that Jesus gave us: ”You are a child of God, beautifully made, loved, forgiven and accepted, created for a divine purpose, destined to be a blessing…&rdquo; Let your Father in heaven determine who you are and what you are.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>If you choose the latter and start building your faith on His story, for sure, your feelings will follow and you will be healed and restored.</p>

<p>The decision is yours.</p>

        <p>Nobody likes failures.</p>

<p>However, failures are more precious than most of us are inclined to think.</p>

<p>In fact, they can become stepping stones towards our final success. Don’t get me wrong, a failure really is a failure, not a success. It&rsquo;s ugly, discouraging, accusing, threatening, judging! However&hellip;</p>

<p>A failure doesn&rsquo;t have to be the final word spoken. The crucial question is, what do you do with it? What comes next?</p>

<p>Think of Thomas Edison. Holding as many as 1093 patents in the United States, and in addition many patents in the United Kingdom, France, and Germany, he probably was one of the most prolific inventors of all times. Edison became famous not only for the widespread impact of his inventions, but also for his unbroken decisiveness to never give up. It is said that before succeeding with his first well-functioning light bulb in 1879, he went through around 2000 failures. When during the time of his endless struggles being asked, why he wouldn’t give up such a meaningless endeavor, he gave his well-known answer. ”It’s not a failure at all”, he said, ”I just found 2000 ways of how not to make a light bulb”.</p>

<p>Inventions are made when someone thinks outside the box and tries to accomplish something that others call impossible, or at least meaningless, and uses every failure as a stepping stone for still another try.</p>

<p>However, our problem is that we are stuck inside the box and all we can do is think inside.</p>

<p>So, how do you manage to think on the outside? What then makes individuals finally free themselves from the bonds of the well-known and secure paths of thought, risk a failure and jump the leap? How do you accomplish such a feat?</p>

<p>Many times, it’s through a deep crisis caused by a failure. Sometimes, it’s out of pure desperation. You are stuck and can&rsquo;t see any way out. You hit the bottom and have nothing to lose.</p>

<p>This is when you are ready to stretch beyond what seems possible.</p>

<p>Seen that way, failures are the condition in which creativity is ignited. They are the soil out of which success springs forth, but only for those who stop mourning and lamenting and decide to try again and go on.</p>

<p>Judas didn’t have to end up in a tragedy. That was his own decision, his own self-made judgement. As Jesus restored Peter, I am sure he was ready to even forgive Judas and open up a new life for him, a life of peace and freedom way beyond his failure.</p>

<p>So how do you think about your recent failure? What’s your decision? Are you ready to welcome and embrace it and learn from it?</p>

<p>And open a new and unexpected door.</p>

<p><strong>Comments</strong></p>

<p><em>Geoffrey:</em>  Thank you Egmont! This is true and I have been in failures many times, and I have seen the hand of God in the end of it. The worst part was when I was laughed at, but I was deeply convicted that God my heavenly father will turn it up for his glory. Thanks again.</p>

<p><em>Reply:</em> Thank you, Geoff! You are right. The Lord is a master of turning things round. We just need to wait.</p>
