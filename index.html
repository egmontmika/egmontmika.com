      <p>I am writing on discipleship, community and mission, basically from two perspectives:</p>
    <p>1) What were the original concepts of discipleship, community and mission that Jesus gave to his first disciples, and what were the practices of the early church?</p>
    <p>2) How can we, in view of common opinions, religious traditions and cultural trends, translate that into our time and world and be genuine and trustworthy followers of Jesus? </p>

        <p>Give to the Lord what he is asking you for!</p>

<p>No one is born as a disciple of Jesus, far less a disciple maker. Yet, this is what Jesus wants us to be, a disciple and a disciple maker.</p>

<p>Accordingly, somewhere along the road, there must be a turning point, or a new start. For every one of us.</p>

<p>We may argue that we are not gifted like evangelist so and so or pastor so and so…, but that’s not the point! They do it their way, and we are asked to do it our way. There is no one else on the planet who can do it just like you and me, and fill the place that only you and I can fill.</p>

<p>If we don’t show up, the Kingdom will lack some important and unique workers.</p>

<p>We may say that we are decent and regular church goers. We have attended hundreds or even thousands of worship services, dozens of bible studies and we are supporting one or several ministries.</p>

<p>That’s all quite impressive and good&hellip; however, being a disciple and making a disciple has little to do with all this. Why did Jesus in his great commission not even mention all these things that today form our Christian culture and keep us busy, week after week?</p>

<p>The question then to ask is: What are we doing? Are we disciple makers?</p>

<p>And by that I am not referring to the success we have achieved&hellip;. we must leave that part up to the Lord. All we need to worry about is: whether we are engaging in such a task or not?</p>

<p>I trust this summer vacation will give us time to reflect on this question.</p>

<p>Discipleship is not a selfish act. It’s a service to the world and to every human soul. We can’t cheat the Lord. But let us not cheat ourselves. And let us also not cheat humanity of our contribution. Instead, let us give each other and the world what we’ve got.</p>

<p>And to the Lord what he is asking us for!</p>

        <p><em>”I want patience, and I want it right NOW!!!”</em></p>

<p>The more you yell, the more you’ll miss it.</p>

<p>No one is born with patience, in fact, the opposite is true. And there is no short-cut to get it. No button to push, no recipe to follow, no course to attend. It’s nothing money can buy…</p>

<p>Patience is learned the hard way. Over time, and through suffering.</p>

<p>By suffering the pain of waiting.</p>

<p>God doesn’t seem to have a problem with it. He is the Master of patience. He can wait. For days and weeks and months and years, and if necessary, a few thousand of them.</p>

<p>Patience is so much part of his character that we can’t even think of him as not being patient. Being patient with <em>us</em>, of course!</p>

<p>We like that idea, yet, it’s not the end of the story. Even in this respect, he wants us to become more like him, share his godly character, and produce some good fruit.</p>

<p>So, if this is his will for you and me, and if this is what we really want, why don’t we go for it?</p>

<p>Welcome every opportunity to train patience and get a little closer to our goal. Or even look out for these opportunities and rejoice whenever we find one.</p>

<p>Every day you can simply find some situation that makes you wait.</p>

<p>And then train yourself in the godly character of being patient. Suffer a little with that purpose in mind…</p>

<p>And enjoy it!</p>
