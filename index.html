      <p>I am writing on discipleship, community and mission, basically from two perspectives:</p>
    <p>1) What were the original concepts of discipleship, community and mission that Jesus gave to his first disciples, and what were the practices of the early church?</p>
    <p>2) How can we, in view of common opinions, religious traditions and cultural trends, translate that into our time and world and be genuine and trustworthy followers of Jesus? </p>

<p>Following Jesus rubs off.</p>

<p>As a disciple of Jesus, you influence your environment and the people around you. Discipleship often develops into leadership.</p>

<p>It’s a different kind of leadership, though. Different from what most people would expect. Often lacking the most typical characteristics that you usually associate with leadership, like power, position, title, status, money, popularity, image, good looks, high IQ, education, or whatever else impresses on people.</p>

<p>It’s an up-side-down leadership. It&rsquo;s built on servanthood and qualities like humility, honesty and integrity. Like trustworthiness, reliability and morality. And faithfulness and wisdom. And love. And the fear of the Lord.</p>

<p>In short, it&rsquo;s spiritual leadership.</p>

<p>True spiritual leadership is based on discipleship, that is, on being a disciple of Jesus. Discipleship comes first, spiritual leadership emerges from there.</p>

<p>You can’t lead another person along a spiritual path without first having walked that path yourself. And you can’t lead that person into a fruitful disciple relationship without being a disciple yourself. The quality of your leadership depends uttermost on the quality of your discipleship. You cannot lead a disciple beyond your own level.</p>

<p>Therefore, are you looking for a spiritual leader? Then, have a closer look at his or her discipleship. Leaders in formal positions are not necessarily fruitful disciples.</p>

<p>On the other hand, fruitful disciples can naturally develop into spiritual leaders, independently of any formal position.</p>

<p>You might be one of them.</p>

<p><strong>Amelie</strong> - LOVE IT!
I always thought I needed more of the typical leadership qualities in order to be a great leader, but I found out that there are people around me that I can disciple. That makes being a leader so easy and it comes so natural.</p>

<p><strong>Susan</strong> - I am begining to see this more and more. Strange that it should take so long for me to arrive at this conclusion&hellip;Truly desire to walk this path with any who sincerely wants to join. :)</p>

        <p><em>Hospitality is an expression of God’s character.</em></p>

<p>Our Lord is a welcoming God. He is generous, nourishing, lavish, joyful…</p>

<p>He is hospitable.</p>

<p>And this is what we are communicating to others when being hospital. It’s as easy as sharing a meal with a friend, a collegue, a neighbor, or a stranger. Or why not a beggar! God is indiscriminate.</p>

<p>He is including.</p>

<p>Your meal doesn’t have to be fancy; don’t let it be exclusive. There is no need to impress on anyone. Just share what you have, it may be abundant or little, a three-course dinner or a glas of water. Or a piece of chocolate or a banana. Just act hospitable according to the situation.</p>

<p>Actually, it’s not so much about the food, but about your attitude, what people sense when they are together with you.</p>

<p>Hospitality is an expression of grace.</p>

<p>You give people an experience of being accepted, respected, appreciated and honored. A sense of belonging without having to qualify or to argue. It breaks the power of fear and alienation and prejudice.</p>

<p>It’s an expression of freedom.</p>

<p>You create an environment of generosity, free from control and free from guilt and accusations. Also free from the need to impress and pretend. Allowing people to be who they are. Giving them your love.</p>

<p>Creating community.</p>

<p>Creating an experience of how God is.</p>
