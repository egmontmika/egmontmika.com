      <p>I am writing on discipleship, community and mission, basically from two perspectives:</p>
    <p>1) What were the original concepts of discipleship, community and mission that Jesus gave to his first disciples, and what were the practices of the early church?</p>
    <p>2) How can we, in view of common opinions, religious traditions and cultural trends, translate that into our time and world and be genuine and trustworthy followers of Jesus? </p>

        <p>Destruction doesn’t always have a  negative connotation. Many times it is an absolutely necessary part of the creative process.</p>

<p>Farm lands are created by tearing down trees, better neighborhoods from slums, new life from destructive habits. They all go through destructive processes before something new could be created.  
Sometimes, new life does not appear unless and until the old has been torn down. It’s not always possible nor is it safe to be building on top of the old.</p>

<p>Sooner or later a conflict will arise between the old and the new and you will have to make a choice. Either adjust and compromise and stay where you are, or tear down and start all over again, on a better foundation.</p>

<p>The same is true for our spiritual life.</p>

<p>A spiritual revival was never started by people whose hearts were still fixed in the past. It rather emerged from something new, a new revelation or a new and fresh spiritual encounter. And as a consequence, there was an overthrowing of the structures and expressions of the old.</p>

<p>In this way, revival not only builds, but also destroys.</p>

<p>If its destructive power scares you, you will not be able to connect to what the Lord is doing today.</p>

<p>In fact, at times the Lord himself is one who ”uproots”, ”tears down”, ”destroys” and ”overthrows” in order to ”build” and to ”plant”. (Jer 1:10)</p>

<p>Probably most of the time, it is wise to adjust, to compromise and to develop slowly. It takes time and endurance to build a house, a family, a church, a business…</p>

<p>However, there are situations when you’ll have to jump the canyon. You can’t do it in small steps.</p>

<p>In case you are in that kind of a situation, the Lord may give you wisdom and courage.</p>

<p>And faith.</p>

        </header>
        <p>So, you are a follower of Jesus?</p>

<p>He is your Lord and Master? And your Teacher? Then, what exactly does he teach you?</p>

<p>No, I am not asking you what you know about him, like when and where he lived, what he did and what he said. Neither am I asking about the doctrines or morals, or whatever your church teaches about him.</p>

<p>What I’m asking is, How does he impact you? I mean, personally. Where does he rub off in your life? How does he influence your thinking, your values and attitudes? And your actions?</p>

<p>In short: How does he lead you?</p>

<p>Do these questions irritate you? Or do they inspire you?</p>

<p>No matter, what your spontaneous reaction is, wouldn’t it be worth while to jot down some of your points?</p>

<p>Would you like to <em>do</em> it?</p>

<p>The challenge for you right now is to not just agree to my idea, but to actually grab a pen and a piece of paper and do it. Not just think, but write. Right now.</p>

<p>You may find it hard to get started, but don’t let that hinder you. The flow will come, just you get over the initial resistance. (Writing almost always meets resistance.) And I’m sure your list will turn out far longer than expected.</p>

<p>Then, choose two or three of your points and meditate a while on each one of them.</p>

<p>And let them give you clarity and strengthen you.</p>

<p><strong>Geoffrey:</strong>
You nailed it brother, thanks for touching the sensitive conditions of our faith in JESUS.
This makes me stand still and find back the true meaning of my calling in him.
Thanks again.
Geoff</p>
