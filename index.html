      <p>I am writing on discipleship, community and mission, basically from two perspectives:</p>
    <p>1) What were the original concepts of discipleship, community and mission that Jesus gave to his first disciples, and what were the practices of the early church?</p>
    <p>2) How can we, in view of common opinions, religious traditions and cultural trends, translate that into our time and world and be genuine and trustworthy followers of Jesus? </p>

        <p>It&rsquo;s not a bad thing to be controversial.</p>

<p>And it’s absolutely no sin.</p>

<p>Anyone who stands up for what is right will meet opposition. The higher your position, the worse it can get. The stronger the rejection and the more disastrous the possible consequences.</p>

<p>The higher your purpose, the higher the cost.</p>

<p>With this in mind, it seems an easier way to adapt, to conform and be nice, trying to please as many as possible. Follow the public opinion, stay politically correct and socially accepted.</p>

<p>Sadly, this is where spiritual movements tend to end. After an initial period of radical commitment, many times ridiculed, despised and hated by its contemporaries, a movement slowly adapts and finally becomes well respected.</p>

<p>This has been the weakness of mainstream Christianity throughout the centuries. And it still is.</p>

<p>“When the salt loses its saltiness it’s not good for anything.”</p>

<p>Not so Jesus. Jesus was controversial. And he still is.</p>

<p>He never bowed under the pressure from his surroundings. Rather than calming down and taking it safe, he kept challenging his opponents to the uttermost.</p>

<p>He was able to stand up against the storm because he was willing to pay the price.</p>

<p>And he finally did.</p>

<p>As his followers, we need to be prepared for being controversial. Being controversial for a high goal can actually be a very good thing. Facing opposition helps you clarify your purpose, sharpen your focus and strengthen your will.</p>

<p>Shows what you go for.</p>

<p>For some of us, being controversial is more than something to suffer.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a necessity.</p>

        <p>Have you experienced this?</p>

<p>You know exactly what would be the right thing to do. Right now, you could change a situation for the better. Help someone, improve an organization, or turn a hopeless situation.</p>

<p>Yet, you hesitate.</p>

<p>Why do you back off?</p>

<p>Is it because of convenience? Or complacency? Or doubt?</p>

<p>Or because of the fear of being taken advantage of? Or because of possible risks? The fear of failure? Would the price be too high?</p>

<p>How can we overcome our inner resistance?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s when we pursue a higher purpose. When our goal is greater and stronger than our desire for comfort, security, and acceptance. Then, obstacles won&rsquo;t scare us. Instead, they make us grow and overcome inner resistance.</p>

<p>When we pursue an important cause and care enough to be willing to pay the price, we don&rsquo;t let anyone or anything scare us. We take courage and get involved.</p>

<p>We speak up, stand up, and take action.</p>

<p>Do good.</p>

<p>Jesus had such a purpose. Paul of Tarsus, Martin Luther King Jr., Mother Teresa and many others of his followers had.</p>

<p>And still have.</p>

<p>Like you and me.</p>
