      <p>I am writing on discipleship, community and mission, basically from two perspectives:</p>
    <p>1) What were the original concepts of discipleship, community and mission that Jesus gave to his first disciples, and what were the practices of the early church?</p>
    <p>2) How can we, in view of common opinions, religious traditions and cultural trends, translate that into our time and world and be genuine and trustworthy followers of Jesus? </p>

        <p>Have you experienced this?</p>

<p>You know exactly what would be the right thing to do. Right now, you could change a situation for the better. Help someone, improve an organization, or turn a hopeless situation.</p>

<p>Yet, you hesitate.</p>

<p>Why do you back off?</p>

<p>Is it because of convenience? Or complacency? Or doubt?</p>

<p>Or because of the fear of being taken advantage of? Or because of possible risks? The fear of failure? Would the price be too high?</p>

<p>How can we overcome our inner resistance?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s when we pursue a higher purpose. When our goal is greater and stronger than our desire for comfort, security, and acceptance. Then, obstacles won&rsquo;t scare us. Instead, they make us grow and overcome inner resistance.</p>

<p>When we pursue an important cause and care enough to be willing to pay the price, we don&rsquo;t let anyone or anything scare us. We take courage and get involved.</p>

<p>We speak up, stand up, and take action.</p>

<p>Do good.</p>

<p>Jesus had such a purpose. Paul of Tarsus, Martin Luther King Jr., Mother Teresa and many others of his followers had.</p>

<p>And still have.</p>

<p>Like you and me.</p>

        <p>Life&rsquo;s value is not defined by its highlights.</p>

<p>Sunday worship services may leave the impression that living the Christian life is a series of elegant meetings. Jumping from celebration to celebration. Like a butterfly, from flower to flower. Looking for the next sensation, the next spiritual experience. With lots of smiles.</p>

<p>Nothing could be more wrong than that.</p>

<p>Rather, it’s the other way around. Your valuable life is the life you live in between the highlights. It’s your daily walk. Including every day, every hour, every minute.</p>

<p>No part of your life is too low, not to be noticed. There is nothing to hide, nothing to be ashamed of, nothing unworthy. Everything counts.</p>

<p>Everything is valuable.</p>

<p>In the Kingdom of God, there are no shadows. Everything is in His light. Also those moments when you come home from work feeling sweaty and dirty. Exhausted or maybe even discouraged. When you are sick or people have betrayed you and everything seems dark. Still, you are in His light. Still, your life is valuable.</p>

<p>YOU are valuable.</p>

<p>One day, when you will look back and draw a balance, it will not be the highlights that added most value to your life, but your relationships. Your daily habits and your daily work.</p>

<p>The fruit of your faithfulness and consistency.</p>

<p>And your love.</p>
