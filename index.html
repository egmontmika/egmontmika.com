      <p>I am writing on discipleship, community and mission, basically from two perspectives:</p>
    <p>1) What were the original concepts of discipleship, community and mission that Jesus gave to his first disciples, and what were the practices of the early church?</p>
    <p>2) How can we, in view of common opinions, religious traditions and cultural trends, translate that into our time and world and be genuine and trustworthy followers of Jesus? </p>

          <p><time>2017/10/11</time>&nbsp;&nbsp;300 words</p>

        <p>Have you ever had a great idea? And tried to make it work?</p>

<p>Tried to change something to the better? To accomplish something important and really worth the effort? Something that would improve your life and the world around you significantly?</p>

<p>Have you tried - and failed?</p>

<p>It’s easy to blame the opposition or people’s ignorance or the circumstances. Or the bureaucracy or the system…</p>

<p>It’s easy to blame and give up.</p>

<p>However, who promised you it would be easy?</p>

<p>If it was easy, you or others would have done it already. The fact that no one did it probably indicates that no one else saw the value of it or thought it was possible or was ready to pay the price. Or could do it for you.</p>

<p>This means that it’s your turn!</p>

<p>However, if you want to make it work you will have to be prepared to pay the price. Have faith against the odds and against what people say. Overcoming your fear. Battling the resistance from within and without. Being prepared to fail many times and learn from it.</p>

<p>Then, try again and endure.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s consistent and persistent effort that leads to success. Great results aren’t accomplished by a try.</p>

<p>But a long-term commitment.</p>

          <h1><a href='http://egmontmika.com/blog/what-are-you-waiting-for/'>What Are You Waiting For?</a></h1>

        <p>Are you ready to make a disciple?</p>

<p>In case your answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo; or &ldquo;not yet&rdquo;, what would you still need?</p>

<p>Jesus trained his disciples for only three and a half years, then sent them out.</p>

<p>Where they fully educated then? - No.</p>

<p>Did they master the skills of an evangelist or preacher or teacher? - Probably not.</p>

<p>In fact, they hardly had the faith necessary, nor the skill, nor the understanding.</p>

<p>Still, Jesus sent them out.</p>

<p>And whatever they were lacking, the Holy Spirit provided.</p>

<p>What they had learned by being with Jesus was not all they could have learned, if they had stayed with him for another decade, but it was good enough for a start.</p>

<p>What the Spirit needed in order to work through these people was not more education, but their willingness.</p>

<p>Are you willing?</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s face it! Believing that spending more time in church services will make you a better disciple maker is an illusion. In fact, it can be counterproductive. The longer you wait, the more you may want to stay. The less you may be willing to go out.</p>

<p>Is that so?</p>

<p>If not, what are you waiting for?</p>
