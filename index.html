      <p>I am writing on discipleship, community and mission, basically from two perspectives:</p>
    <p>1) What were the original concepts of discipleship, community and mission that Jesus gave to his first disciples, and what were the practices of the early church?</p>
    <p>2) How can we, in view of common opinions, religious traditions and cultural trends, translate that into our time and world and be genuine and trustworthy followers of Jesus? </p>

        <p>You can’t save the whole world.</p>

<p>However, there is at least one for whom you can make all the difference. The difference between life and death.</p>

<p>There is a well-known story about a man, who on his morning walk along the beach watches a boy picking up starfishes and throwing them back into the water. When asked about his doing the boy replied, I’m saving starfishes. If they stay on the beach, they will die.</p>

<p>Looking along the beach and imagining the hundreds of starfishes still lying there the man shook his head. You will not be able to save them all, he said. Maybe not, the boy replied, and by picking up another starfish and throwing it back into the water he continued, For this one, it makes all the difference.</p>

<p>As a follower of Jesus, you may not be able to save the whole world. However, to the ones you reach with the gospel, it will make all the difference.</p>

<p>The difference between life and death, even if it was only one.</p>

<p>Let it be at least one.</p>

        <p>Some people seem never to learn.</p>

<p>They leave their crumbs on the table, put their dirty coffee cup in the sink, spit their chewing gum on top, and just don’t see - and smell - that the trash is overflowing.</p>

<p>Don’t they know any better?</p>

<p>If this were the case, the solution would be to inform them and show them how to finish a coffee break properly.</p>

<p>However, not knowing rarely is the reason. You may call it an attitude. These people just don’t care. Or, let’s say, they don&rsquo;t care for what you care. They just seem to have other preferences.</p>

<p>Do we have to put up with that? Can we change someone’s values or preferences?</p>

<p>Some of us would say, It&rsquo;s impossible, and consider these people hopeless cases. Probably, this would be right if we are expecting the shift to happen on the spot. Pointing a finger, though, seldom changes someone&rsquo;s attitude or preferences and yelling at them won’t accomplish much; at best you will get a hypocrite.</p>

<p>If we want to see real change, we need to address a deeper level of consciousness. We will have to engage and teach and communicate in a way that shares our emotions, insights, values, and beliefs.</p>

<p>Jesus wouldn&rsquo;t call anyone a hopeless case, far less start moralizing. Instead, he would aim at changing the people from the inside. And for a higher purpose than just raising their outward behavior.</p>

<p>He would try to touch their heart.</p>

<p>How do you do that?</p>
