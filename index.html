      <p>I am writing on discipleship, community and mission, basically from two perspectives:</p>
    <p>1) What were the original concepts of discipleship, community and mission that Jesus gave to his first disciples, and what were the practices of the early church?</p>
    <p>2) How can we, in view of common opinions, religious traditions and cultural trends, translate that into our time and world and be genuine and trustworthy followers of Jesus? </p>

        <p>Progress and comfort don’t match.</p>

<p>While not everything that is uncomfortable automatically will give you progress, there will always be a certain amount of inconvenience going along with it.</p>

<p>Performance spikes when we’re doing something out of our norm.</p>

<p>This is not only true for sports, but probably for all areas of life, for instance, our spiritual life.</p>

<p>Throughout Scripture, we find that following God’s call and striving for a comfortable life seem to contradict each other. Typically, responding to his call is associated with the requirement of stepping out and leaving. Leaving your family and friends, your familiar environment, and your securities. Changing some of your dear preferences and habits.</p>

<p>Jesus never promised his disciples a comfortable life, yet, he expected them to be ”fruitful”.  For those who wanted to follow him, he pointed out what they could expect: inconveniences, uncertainty, mockery, hatred, and persecution.</p>

<p>Is this too much to expect?</p>

<p>It probably is, but not for those who have made up their minds. They are looking forward to their goal and consider it worthwhile the trouble. They know that hardship makes them achieve more than they ever dreamed possible.</p>

<p>They have learned to take advantage of the uncomfortable.</p>

<p>And they enjoy it.</p>

<p>They have learned the art of enjoying the uncomfortable.</p>

          <h1><a href='http://egmontmika.com/blog/three-steps-to-overcome-worrying/'>Three Steps to Overcome Worrying</a></h1>
          <p><time>2018/01/15</time>&nbsp;&nbsp;300 words</p>

        <p>Worrying is NOT a virtue.</p>

<p>On the contrary, it’s absolutely destructive. It’s a poison.</p>

<p>Worrying obscures your faith, weakens your strength, takes away your initiative, and quenches your creativity.</p>

<p>It steals your joy.</p>

<p>Worrying breaks you down spiritually, mentally, and physically. And it keeps you from doing your work.</p>

<p>It keeps you from living your life.</p>

<p>It’s easy to make people and circumstances responsible for your worries. Yet, they are not the producers. Worrying starts with a fearful thought in our own mind, with fearing things to get worse or something dreadful to happen. However, these things have not happened yet, and chances are, they will never happen.</p>

<p>Worrying is a product of our mind.</p>

<p>Outside of us, this fearful thought does not even exist, yet, to us it’s real. And by entertaining it, we let it slowly break down our spiritual and mental health, with possible symptoms even in our physical body.</p>

<p>How can we get rid of it? Here are three steps:</p>

<ul>
<li>Take an intentional decision NOT to worry. Just refuse to submit to that thought.</li>
<li>Then, do whatever is possible for you to avoid whatever it is you fear.</li>
<li>Finally, focus on a better and higher goal and trust God that there will be a solution, in case things get worse.</li>
</ul>

<p>Jesus said, Do not worry! Seek first God’s kingdom! He sternly commanded his disciples not to fear and not to worry. Instead, he prompted them to prioritize God&rsquo;s kingdom.</p>

<p>Worrying is worthless. It doesn&rsquo;t change anything for the better.</p>

<p>However, to take action and to trust God is wise.</p>

<p>This is practicing your faith.</p>
