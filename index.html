      <p>I am writing on discipleship, community and mission, basically from two perspectives:</p>
    <p>1) What were the original concepts of discipleship, community and mission that Jesus gave to his first disciples, and what were the practices of the early church?</p>
    <p>2) How can we, in view of common opinions, religious traditions and cultural trends, translate that into our time and world and be genuine and trustworthy followers of Jesus? </p>

        <p>Don’t work FOR the Lord! Work WITH him!</p>

<p>Why are there so many discouraged and burned-out pastors? Why do so many leave the ministry? Didn’t Jesus say that his burden would be light?</p>

<p>Maybe ministry has become too heavy, because too much has been added by man. Too much of human ambitions and desires to influence and accomplish and control. Too much of duties, worries and fear.</p>

<p>Jesus simply expects us to follow him and make disciples. Then, naturally, we take care of each other as a family.</p>

<p>This is not a problem, as long as there is no position to achieve or to keep. And no other obligations and expectations that come along with it are stealing your focus.</p>

<p>Without position, you can do as little or as much as you are able to, or have faith for, or think that you can afford. In this way, your burden is self-regulating. It never grows beyond your ability and your faith. Still, it can grow, slowly enough to enable you to grow along with it.</p>

<p>I don’t think we need to make up a great vision or strategy or plan, just because this is what all the leadership books tell us and what every great church seems to have. It&rsquo;s just a guessing anyway. And a burden. Or even a curse.</p>

<p>And we don’t need to prove our spirituality or ability as a leader to anyone, neither to ourselves. The Lord leads by his Spirit and defines what success is, and he alone is to be honoured.</p>

<p>So, don’t worry.</p>

<p>Don’t worry about &ldquo;your ministry&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s not yours anyway, but Jesus&rsquo;. And don&rsquo;t submit to wrong expectations from others. Instead, find out what the Lord already has prepared for you.</p>

<p>And join in WITH him!</p>

        <p>There is no better way of teaching and learning than the hands-on training in real life situations.</p>

<ul>
<li>If you want to learn how to walk, you&rsquo;ll have to start walking.</li>
<li>If you want to learn how to ride a bike, you&rsquo;ll have to start biking.</li>
<li>If you want to learn how to swim, you&rsquo;ll have to start swimming.</li>
</ul>

<p>No matter how lousy you may feel in the beginning, you&rsquo;ll just have to do it.</p>

<p>In the same way: If you want to learn how to make a disciple, you&rsquo;ll have to start making one.</p>

<ul>
<li>More sermons will not take you there, no matter how good they are.</li>
<li>More Bible studies will not do it, no matter how much knowledge you get.</li>
<li>Neither will more prayer, no matter how much more you pray&hellip;</li>
</ul>

<p>&hellip;if you never take the first step.</p>

<p>There is no other way.</p>

<p>Just do it!</p>
