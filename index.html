      <p>I am writing on discipleship, community and mission, basically from two perspectives:</p>
    <p>1) What were the original concepts of discipleship, community and mission that Jesus gave to his first disciples, and what were the practices of the early church?</p>
    <p>2) How can we, in view of common opinions, religious traditions and cultural trends, translate that into our time and world and be genuine and trustworthy followers of Jesus? </p>

          <p><time>2016/05/26</time>&nbsp;&nbsp;700 words</p>
        </header>
        <p>He was a pastor. A gifted preacher and brilliant Bible school teacher, respected and loved by his church and his large family, particularly known and appreciated for his books and seminars on family relationships.</p>

<p>Then the unexpected happened.</p>

<p>In short, one day he left his wife and family, quit his ministry and moved to a far away country in order to start all over again, leaving his family, co-workers and church members behind in shock.</p>

<p>In a letter, he described his desperation, revealing that he had been depressed for a longer period, feeling like a failure and even planned to take his life.</p>

<p>For the last three years he had been trying to keep a mask and fulfill his duty as a pastor, trying to perform whatever was expected. But now he just couldn’t do it anymore.</p>

<p>The mask had to be removed.</p>

<p>Tragic and alarming! This story may seem exceptional, at least in its final, shocking consequences. However, wearing a mask isn’t that exceptional, not among people in general, neither among believers. In fact, it seems to be a behavior particularly found in certain church cultures, practiced by common people like you and me.</p>

<p>It’s not necessary to be a pastor in order to fall into that pit. Anyone can end up there.</p>

<p>So, what could make believers and Christian workers resort to wearing a mask? And why is it so common? What can we learn from this tragedy?</p>

<p>The reason seems to be fear. The fear of failing and being exposed and rejected, maybe due to a gap between a person&rsquo;s abilities and the leadership position he was given and unable to fill. In order to compensate for the lack, he resorts to wearing a mask, pretending an ability or spirituality he does not possess.</p>

<p>We could call it hypocrisy, yet, let me add another aspect.</p>

<p>Could it also be due to the gap, which the people around him produced by expecting him to be someone else than he really is? This person may be totally honest, not pretending anything, nevertheless, people identify him with the role they want him to play according to their own concept, according to how they picture him in their imagination.</p>

<p>They may want to see him as the strong leader, the man or woman of God, the apostle, the prophet or the performer of miracles, someone who makes things happen, things that satisfy their desire for affirmation and spiritual experiences.</p>

<p>This could be rapid church growth or anything supernatural, something that gives them a sense of God’s presence, anything that produces the desired spiritual kick they might be missing in their own private lives.</p>

<p>No matter, whether it is a projection of people&rsquo;s desires or a compensation of their own failures, a tragedy like the one described should not only be seen as one person&rsquo;s, but also the people’s responsibility, as the outcome of a church environment, a hype that people bought into and cultivated, leaders as well as the ones being lead.</p>

<p>So, what can we do? How can we get out of the trap?</p>

<p>To begin with, there must be an insight. We don&rsquo;t need to be another spiritual super star or stage hero and there is no need for a success story. Instead, we can remind ourselves of God&rsquo;s grace given once and for all times and more than enough for everyone of us. Let&rsquo;s enjoy this grace and together walk the common daily walk of life in love, faith and hope, filled with gratitude.</p>

<p>Lifting any burden of guilt and shame from each other and together enjoy our lives in God&rsquo;s redemption.</p>

<p>Removing our masks - becoming vulnerable.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not a shame, but a first step into the freedom of an authentic life.</p>

          <h1><a href='http://egmontmika.com/blog/is-your-church-stable/'>How &#39;Stable&#39; Shall We Be?</a></h1>
          <p><time>2016/05/11</time>&nbsp;&nbsp;400 words</p>
        </header>
        <p>One significant characteristic of any organization is the pursuit of stability. The same is true for churches and home groups.</p>

<p>Stability gives us a sense of security, peace and success. The turbulent times of initial struggles are over and we finally arrived at a place where we can lean back and enjoy our accomplishments. Now, we are established and we finally have been accepted by our surroundings. And we know how to run this church.</p>

<p>We are ”maturer”, now.</p>

<p>From now on, all we have to do is to protect what we have got and keep growing from there. Protect it against possible agitators and trouble-makers, against know-it-alls and fault finders, and against these far too creative people and their never-ending ideas. And, last not least, against the naivety of those newcomers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let people come in, but not up!&rdquo; (Pastor of a mega church)</p>

<p>We really don’t want to make the same mistakes over and over again, and we&rsquo;re tired of explaining everything a thousand times. Neither do we want to make any new mistakes. Why take a risk, when everything is so well settled?</p>

<p>This is the point when we get stuck in our own ways of doing things, when securing our success becomes a dominant factor and our mission locked in within the boundaries of our home made stability. This is when we give up to engage, to thrive and to change.</p>

<p>This is when we close our doors.</p>

<p>The decline has begun and it’s the beginning of the end. For a while, we still enjoy the cosiness and familiarity of a well-established, stable community and the self-affirmation that comes along with it, maybe also a little hubris (”We&rsquo;re a good church and way up front.”).</p>

<p>Then comes the boredom.</p>

<p>Soon, the average age of our group is getting alarmingly close to 70 and we don’t know what to do about it.</p>

<p>The solution would be to start all over again. To take risks, to stretch our possibilities, to accept challenges, to explore the unknown, to humble ourselves and engage with people.</p>

<p>To give up stability - and get messy again.</p>

<p>We may loose our stability, the cosiness and familiarity of our fellowship, our comfort, complacency and respectability…</p>

<p>We may loose it all -</p>

<p>but again, win souls and make disciples for Jesus.</p>

<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be worth it?</p>
