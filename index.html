      <p>I am writing on discipleship, community and mission, basically from two perspectives:</p>
    <p>1) What were the original concepts of discipleship, community and mission that Jesus gave to his first disciples, and what were the practices of the early church?</p>
    <p>2) How can we, in view of common opinions, religious traditions and cultural trends, translate that into our time and world and be genuine and trustworthy followers of Jesus? </p>

          <h1><a href='http://egmontmika.com/blog/is-your-church-stable/'>How &#39;Stable&#39; Shall We Be?</a></h1>
          <p><time>2016/05/11</time>&nbsp;&nbsp;400 words</p>
        </header>
        <p>One significant characteristic of any organization is the pursuit of stability. The same is true for churches and home groups.</p>

<p>Stability gives us a sense of security, peace and success. The turbulent times of initial struggles are over and we finally arrived at a place where we can lean back and enjoy our accomplishments. Now, we are established and we finally have been accepted by our surroundings. And we know how to run this church.</p>

<p>We are ”maturer”, now.</p>

<p>From now on, all we have to do is to protect what we have got and keep growing from there. Protect it against possible agitators and trouble-makers, against know-it-alls and fault finders, and against these far too creative people and their never-ending ideas. And, last not least, against the naivety of those newcomers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let people come in, but not up!&rdquo; (Pastor of a mega church)</p>

<p>We really don’t want to make the same mistakes over and over again, and we&rsquo;re tired of explaining everything a thousand times. Neither do we want to make any new mistakes. Why take a risk, when everything is so well settled?</p>

<p>This is the point when we get stuck in our own ways of doing things, when securing our success becomes a dominant factor and our mission locked in within the boundaries of our home made stability. This is when we give up to engage, to thrive and to change.</p>

<p>This is when we close our doors.</p>

<p>The decline has begun and it’s the beginning of the end. For a while, we still enjoy the cosiness and familiarity of a well-established, stable community and the self-affirmation that comes along with it, maybe also a little hubris (”We&rsquo;re a good church and way up front.”).</p>

<p>Then comes the boredom.</p>

<p>Soon, the average age of our group is getting alarmingly close to 70 and we don’t know what to do about it.</p>

<p>The solution would be to start all over again. To take risks, to stretch our possibilities, to accept challenges, to explore the unknown, to humble ourselves and engage with people.</p>

<p>To give up stability - and get messy again.</p>

<p>We may loose our stability, the cosiness and familiarity of our fellowship, our comfort, complacency and respectability…</p>

<p>We may loose it all -</p>

<p>but again, win souls and make disciples for Jesus.</p>

<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it be worth it?</p>

          <h1><a href='http://egmontmika.com/blog/numbers-numbers/'>Numbers, Numbers, Numbers!</a></h1>
          <p><time>2016/04/28</time>&nbsp;&nbsp;400 words</p>
        </header>
        <p>Church leaders tend to be highly interested in numbers.</p>

<p>Typically, they ask questions like, How many members does the church have, how high is the weekly attendance and how much did the offering bring? And they want to know how these numbers develop from week to week, month to month and year to year.</p>

<p>Admitted, statistics are useful. They enable us to measure and to compare, to set up goals and to stay focussed, and they make us feel successful whenever numbers go up. Numbers seem to show a church’s growth in a reliable, objective way. At least, this is what we tend to think.</p>

<p>Yet, there is a problem.</p>

<p>How can we ever measure essential spiritual qualities like faith and love, fear of the Lord, obedience, maturity and Christlikeness, community and the power of a church’s testimony by counting numbers?</p>

<p>How can we ever find out anything about the quality and the actual spiritual outcome of a church by just measuring quantities?</p>

<p>For instance, does the amount of hours that someone spends participating in church activities say anything about the quality of this person&rsquo;s discipleship? Or can numbers about a church’s widespread popularity and numerical and financial success be translated into significant impact - in terms of fulfilling the church&rsquo;s mission to make disciples?</p>

<p>If spiritual qualities and the actual outcome of the church are not included in our statistics, what do those statistics really say? And what do we accomplish by maximizing these numbers?</p>

<p>In the light of the church’s mission, the ultimate question for a leader and for every follower of Jesus must be, Do we really make disciples of Jesus or are we just having programs? And furthermore, do those who have been discipled, in their part, go on and make disciples? These questions are crucial, as they touch the very nerve of the church&rsquo;s mission.</p>

<p>In this perspective, making a handful of quality disciples may by far outweigh a thousand more names of members or attendees on our lists. After all, disciples are the kind of result that Jesus is expecting. We can&rsquo;t fool him.</p>

<p>Yet, are we possibly fooling ourselves?</p>
