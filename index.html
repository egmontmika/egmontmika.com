      <p>I am writing on discipleship, community and mission, basically from two perspectives:</p>
    <p>1) What were the original concepts of discipleship, community and mission that Jesus gave to his first disciples, and what were the practices of the early church?</p>
    <p>2) How can we, in view of common opinions, religious traditions and cultural trends, translate that into our time and world and be genuine and trustworthy followers of Jesus? </p>

        <p>Life&rsquo;s value is not defined by the highlights.</p>

<p>Sunday worship services may leave the impression that living the Christian life is a series of elegant meetings. Jumping from celebration to celebration. Like a butterfly, from flower to flower. Looking for the next sensation, the next spiritual experience. With lots of smiles.</p>

<p>Nothing could be more wrong than that.</p>

<p>Rather, it’s the other way around. Your valuable life is the life you live in between the highlights. It’s your daily walk. Including every day, every hour, every minute.</p>

<p>No part of your life is too low, not to be noticed. There is nothing to hide, nothing to be ashamed of, nothing unworthy. Everything counts.</p>

<p>Everything is valuable.</p>

<p>In the Kingdom of God, there are no shadows. Everything is in His light. Also those moments when you feel sweaty and dirty from work. Exhausted and discouraged. When you are sick or people have betrayed you and everything seems dark. Still, you are in His light.</p>

<p>YOU are valuable.</p>

<p>One day, when you will look back and sum up your life, it will not be the highlights that added most value to your life, but your relationships. Your daily habits and your daily work.</p>

<p>The fruit of your faithfulness and consistency.</p>

<p>And your love.</p>

        <p>Have you ever had a great idea? And tried to make it work?</p>

<p>Tried to change something to the better? To accomplish something important and really worth the effort? Something that would improve your life and the world around you significantly?</p>

<p>Have you tried - and failed?</p>

<p>It’s easy to blame the opposition or people’s ignorance or the circumstances. Or the bureaucracy or the system…</p>

<p>It’s easy to blame and give up.</p>

<p>However, who promised you it would be easy?</p>

<p>If it was easy, you or others would have done it already. The fact that no one did it probably indicates that no one else saw the value of it or thought it was possible or was ready to pay the price. Or could do it for you.</p>

<p>This means that it’s your turn!</p>

<p>However, if you want to make it work you will have to be prepared to pay the price. Have faith against the odds and against what people say. Overcoming your fear. Battling the resistance from within and without. Being prepared to fail many times and learn from it.</p>

<p>Then, try again and endure.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s consistent and persistent effort that leads to success. Great results aren’t accomplished by one try.</p>

<p>But a long-term commitment.</p>
