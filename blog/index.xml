      <title>Your Valuable Life</title>
      <link>http://egmontmika.com/blog/your-valuable-life2/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Life&amp;rsquo;s value is not defined by the highlights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunday worship services may leave the impression that living the Christian life is a series of elegant meetings. Jumping from celebration to celebration. Like a butterfly, from flower to flower. Looking for the next sensation, the next spiritual experience. With lots of smiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing could be more wrong than that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather, it’s the other way around. Your valuable life is the life you live in between the highlights. It’s your daily walk. Including every day, every hour, every minute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No part of your life is too low, not to be noticed. There is nothing to hide, nothing to be ashamed of, nothing unworthy. Everything counts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything is valuable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Kingdom of God, there are no shadows. Everything is in His light. Also those moments when you come home from work feeling sweaty and dirty. Exhausted or maybe even discouraged. When you are sick or people have betrayed you and everything seems dark. Still, you are in His light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;YOU are valuable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day, when you will look back and sum up your life, it will not be the highlights that added most value to your life, but your relationships. Your daily habits and your daily work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fruit of your faithfulness and consistency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And your love.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Power of Long-Term Commitment</title>
      <link>http://egmontmika.com/blog/the-power-of-commitment/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever had a great idea? And tried to make it work?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tried to change something to the better? To accomplish something important and really worth the effort? Something that would improve your life and the world around you significantly?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you tried - and failed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to blame the opposition or people’s ignorance or the circumstances. Or the bureaucracy or the system…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to blame and give up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, who promised you it would be easy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it was easy, you or others would have done it already. The fact that no one did it probably indicates that no one else saw the value of it or thought it was possible or was ready to pay the price. Or could do it for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that it’s your turn!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if you want to make it work you will have to be prepared to pay the price. Have faith against the odds and against what people say. Overcoming your fear. Battling the resistance from within and without. Being prepared to fail many times and learn from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, try again and endure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s consistent and persistent effort that leads to success. Great results aren’t accomplished by one try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But a long-term commitment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What Are You Waiting For?</title>
      <link>http://egmontmika.com/blog/what-are-you-waiting-for/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 28 Sep 2017 03:01:45 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://egmontmika.com/blog/what-are-you-waiting-for/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Are you ready to make a disciple?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case your answer is &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;not yet&amp;rdquo;, what would you still need?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus trained his disciples for only three and a half years, then sent them out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where they fully educated then? - No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did they master the skills of an evangelist or preacher or teacher? - Probably not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, they hardly had the faith necessary, nor the skill, nor the understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, Jesus sent them out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And whatever they were lacking, the Holy Spirit provided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What they had learned by being with Jesus was not all they could have learned, if they had stayed with him for another decade, but it was good enough for a start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What the Spirit needed in order to work through these people was not more education, but their willingness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you willing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s face it! Believing that spending more time in church services will make you a better disciple maker is an illusion. In fact, it can be counterproductive. The longer you wait, the more you may want to stay. The less you may be willing to go out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is that so?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If not, what are you waiting for?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How Many Sermons Do You Need?</title>
      <link>http://egmontmika.com/blog/how-many-sermons/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 12 Sep 2017 03:01:45 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://egmontmika.com/blog/how-many-sermons/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;How many sermons do you need in order to become a disciple?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or maybe a few. The rest is modelling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, modelling is not done from the pulpit, but in everyday life. By sharing experiences, communicating kingdom values, demonstrating these values and explaining the hows and whys. Learning to listen to the Spirit and then follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By taking action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Admitted, preparation can take a life time. There will always be something more to learn, more to understand and more to prepare. Yet, when is a disciple ready to reach out and make another disciple?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many sermons does it take a disciple to make another disciple?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably none. Again, disciple makers are not made from the pulpit, and not in classes. Speeches and curriculums won&amp;rsquo;t take you there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll just have to do it. Jump the leap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have been a disciple of Jesus for a while, let’s say, for a few months or a year or maybe even two, then you can do it. And if you still feel you need help, then find someone who is engaged in this kind of work and ask that person, if you may join him or her for a while. Just in order to turn the corner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t that be a good start?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Church and Money</title>
      <link>http://egmontmika.com/blog/church-and-money/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 30 Aug 2017 03:01:45 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://egmontmika.com/blog/church-and-money/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;”It’s all about money!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what we hear the critics say, while pointing at the large amounts of money collected by Christian ministries today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;”No, it’s not true”, we answer, believing to have a better understanding. ”It’s all about Jesus and the Good News and about saving people for eternity. It’s about mission. Of course, this costs money. The more money we give, the more people we can reach.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to find out if this is true, let’s look at some statistics. How is the money spent and what is being accomplished?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to investigations from 2015, www.thetravelingteam.org, all church members around the globe gave in one year on average 1,7% of their income to churches. 2,9% of this money was used for mission inside their own countries and 0,3% for mission in unreached, non-christian countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the largest part, 96,8%, was used for building the local church, that is, went mainly to salaries and buildings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, we are witnessing Christian movements in the third world, and not only there, with an unparallelled growth in history, yet, with very limited financial resources. These are grass-root movements, carried by the believers and their families, many of them poor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, some of these fast growing movements are operating under extremely difficult circumstances and even suffering persecution, like in China, South-Asia, and the Middle East. According to Open Doors every month hundreds of believers are killed because of their faith.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless this amazing growth!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to think that we could accomplish so much more for the Lord, if we just had more money and could give more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is that so?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Building a Fortune</title>
      <link>http://egmontmika.com/blog/building-a-fortune/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 07 Jun 2017 03:01:45 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://egmontmika.com/blog/building-a-fortune/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;You can’t buy trust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, it’s one of the greatest assets you can have. It’s a fortune.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first glance, building trust seems simple. You say what you are going to do and then do what you said. You keep your promises. You act out your words. Never giving less, rather a little more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without any hidden agenda, without cutting corners. Without faking the results. And without covering up your mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without pretending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Showing up on time - doing your work - completing it. Period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No need to make it look fancier. No need to add more or better promises. Just keep the ones you already made. No need to improve your image; it’s not a matter of marketing, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just be the person you say you are and do what is right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s as simple as that, indeed. But alas! It’s not always easy. We hardly get it without effort and sometimes it takes great courage. And for some of us it just seems impossible, as long as we are hiding something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to build a fortune of trust, you’ve got to be honest. Absolutely, radically honest. At times, and for a while, this may make you look like a looser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a price to pay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the long run, though, reliabilty and honesty will pay and amount to much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hello friends!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was my last blogpost for this season. The school year in Sweden is rapidly coming to an end and it&amp;rsquo;s time for a summer break.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading my articles and joining me in the journey. I hope you enjoyed reading at least some of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll be back to you in September. Would you like to get a reminder by email? Then, make sure you have signed up by entering your email address in the top right corner of this page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, in case you never commented on any of my blogposts since last fall, this is the last chance you can do it. I&amp;rsquo;d love to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have a nice summer.
Be blessed with the joy in the Lord!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yours,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Egmont&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Don&#39;t Go to Church!</title>
      <link>http://egmontmika.com/blog/don%27t-go-to-church/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 23 May 2017 03:01:45 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://egmontmika.com/blog/don%27t-go-to-church/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Church isn&amp;rsquo;t the same as a worship service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing you &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;go to&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neither a program nor an event. Far less a building, an organisation or a denomination. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t that from the beginning, and it still isn&amp;rsquo;t meant to be that today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is it, then?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a family, a movement, a divine fellowship. A calling and a mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s what we are born into as followers of Jesus, redeemed through him, reconciled with our Father in heaven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By his grace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://molongnacua.com/being-church/?blogsub=confirmed#blog_subscription-3&#34;&gt;Molong Nacua&lt;/a&gt;, a Jesus follower from the Filipines, put it this way:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Church is where Christ lives, not the place where we meet. It is Christ-empowered people, a kingdom of priests for the purpose of winning against the works of the devil and establishing God&amp;rsquo;s Kingdom.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s about who we &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. In Christ. Then follow him. Listen and obey. No matter where, no matter when - everywhere, at all times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;go to&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; church. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Be&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; church.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Coming Just a Little Earlier</title>
      <link>http://egmontmika.com/blog/just-a-little-earlier/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 10 May 2017 03:01:45 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://egmontmika.com/blog/just-a-little-earlier/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some are late comers by habit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To them, it seems all right to always show up &amp;ldquo;just a little late&amp;rdquo;. Nobody will take notice anyway, it seems. And others will be late as well, they think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To them, coming late is all right, as long as they don’t miss the highlights and as long as they get what they are expecting. And fulfill their social duty to show up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why invest more time than necessary?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, others may always want to come a little earlier. Be there before the program starts. Offering a little extra time. Just for being mentally prepared. Or for encouraging the host. Or for making themselves available. Like being able to lend a helping hand for the last preparations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or for chatting with another early comer. Encourage someone who came with a need, with the desire to meet someone who would listen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming a little earlier gives you time to connect. Time to build a relationship. Time to care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s precious time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may not want to miss it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Taking Advantage of a Crisis</title>
      <link>http://egmontmika.com/blog/taking-advantage-of-a-crisis/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 26 Apr 2017 03:01:45 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://egmontmika.com/blog/taking-advantage-of-a-crisis/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;You can hear an inspiring message. You can read a life-changing book.
You can get overwhelmed by a new insight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, see nothing change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most of us, consuming such content just isn’t strong enough
to break through the habits and mental strongholds that we have built up over time.
Not strong enough to overcome our desire for comfort and to crack our fear.
We rather hold on to a lousy status-quo that makes us feel safe than take a step into the unknown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why a personal crisis can work as a door opener, but only if it
is stronger than our desire for comfort and stronger than our fear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to move forward, good insights are just not good enough.
Probably we also need, from time to time, a period of destabilisation. That is, a real good crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The secret of success is to accept the crisis and make it your friend. Take
 advantage of the insecurity that comes along with it, collect your strength and intentionally work for a break-through. This is the time to do it. Not waiting for the storm to calm down neither looking behind, but focussing on the future with decisiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For moving into a better future, a crisis can be inestimably valuable. Don&amp;rsquo;t let it become a stumbling block.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, make it a stepping stone.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Investing</title>
      <link>http://egmontmika.com/blog/investing-in-the-future/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 12 Apr 2017 03:01:45 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s never too late to invest in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best time to plant a tree was twenty years ago, it is said.
Yet, the second best time is now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s never too late to plant a tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter how old you are, today you can start an education, start learning a language, start changeing a habit, start building a house, start a project&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today you can invest in your future. And in others&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our lives are far more significant than we tend to think at the moment. Every single one of us is the center of a sphere of influence. And we are reaching out, not only to the people around us during our own life time, but also to those who come after us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They may not know who was the planter, yet they enjoy your tree and its fruit. And they may not always know who built that house or who started that project. Yet, they still enjoy its benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today you can invest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s never too late.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to Cope with Short-Time Pressure</title>
      <link>http://egmontmika.com/blog/how-to-cope-with-short-time-pressure/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 29 Mar 2017 03:01:45 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://egmontmika.com/blog/how-to-cope-with-short-time-pressure/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just make this phone call&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then prepare the dinner, pick up the kids, clean the house, buy a birthday present, fix the bike, get a haircut, wash the clothes, read the manual, answer the emails… The list seems endless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you cope with short-time pressure?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question is, what is &lt;em&gt;important&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;urgent&lt;/em&gt;? Not everything important is also urgent. And not everything urgent is also important. And some things that claim to be both are neither one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let’s have a look at the four options and find out how to cope with them, one by one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Urgent &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; important. - Settle these things right away or as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Important, &lt;em&gt;but not&lt;/em&gt; urgent. - Schedule a time when you want to do this or reserve a fixed time every day, week or month. Then follow that schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Urgent, &lt;em&gt;but not&lt;/em&gt; important. - Two options:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a. Let someone else do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;b. Don’t spoil your precious recreation or family time or your best working hours with that. Maybe you can do it while commuting or sitting in a waiting room or watching the news. Or when you are too tired for more important things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not urgent &lt;em&gt;and not&lt;/em&gt; important. - Two options:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a. Never do it. And never let your mind get occupied with it. Don’t let junkmail lie around, but trash it right away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;b. Write it on a seperate to-do-list for less important things and keep it there. Some matters get settled by themselves after a while. Then delete them. Or you settle them when they become urgent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to make this work, you may want to make a deal with yourself and decide about your priorities. You can’t do all things at all times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clarify for yourself what your purpose is or your mission. What do you want to accomplish or improve or maximise? Why are you into this career? Who do you want to serve?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you know your priorities, stay consistant and let them guide you. Then, confirm or renew your decision from time to time when not under pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will keep short-time pressure away and get you where you want.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Time Savers</title>
      <link>http://egmontmika.com/blog/time-savers/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 16 Mar 2017 22:44:14 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://egmontmika.com/blog/time-savers/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Time is limited. Time is precious. Time is running out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Life&lt;/em&gt; is running out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Civilisation, in turn, has blessed us with an abundance of time savers: dishwashers and washing machines, vacuum cleaners, lawn mowers, cars, airplanes, cellphones, computers…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where does all the time go that we are constantly &amp;ldquo;saving&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With calendars full to the brim, people seem to have less time than ever before. In order to meet with a friend, I may have to book an appointment several weeks ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The truth is that none of us literally ”saves” any time. The amount of time we have stays always the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the contrary, many of these time savers may rather shorten our lives. We may seriously damage our health by eating too much time saving, processed foods or by doing too much time saving computer work. Not to mention the stress created by a time saving life style. Some of us shorten their lives drastically by getting killed during a time saving car trip….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What all these time savers give us is not more time but more choice. More than ever before can we choose what to do with our time. Choose what is important. Do what is meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do what is right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly enough, we often end up filling that time with even more time savers. More computer work and more car trips. Working for still more money which enables us to buy even more time savers&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are your choices?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Letting Go</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;No use to spend hours pondering on the past - regretting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may say that you can learn from it. Yes, but any useful lesson from the past doesn’t take more than a few seconds, or maybe minutes. Anything
longer than that may become destructive. The past is gone and will
never come back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, pondering on the future can be very rewarding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The future gives you the opportunity to make a better decision, find a better solution, get better results, and avoid the old mistakes. The future is filled with possibilities and choices - good choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is, if you first let go the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you let go?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can start your future right away - by letting go and pondering on the future. Admitted, the actual work still needs to be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, it&amp;rsquo;s a good start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anonym&lt;/em&gt; Hej Egmont, tack för dagens inlägg, stämmer så väl, det är så lätt att fastna i det negativa man varit med om och ge det alldeles för mycket tid. Vi får kasta oss på Gud som verkligen känner till alla detaljer i våra liv och vill att vi ska bli stilla och lyssna in vad han vill säga oss. Uppskattar din blogg som har en enkelhet samtidigt som den är djup.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Radical Edge</title>
      <link>http://egmontmika.com/blog/the-radical-edge/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Growing spiritual movements often have a radical edge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their followers are filled with a vision and strongly committed to their mission. They gladly step out of
their comfort zone, take great risks, are willing to sacrifice, and work day and night,
paying the price in order to fulfill that mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first followers of Jesus became such a movement. And today they still are, that is, wherever they
genuinely follow Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, large chunks of this movement became and still become watered-down over time, loosing their
radicality and their edge. Thinking they have been too radical, too zealous, too different from the world
 around them, they may feel the need to become more “normal”, regarded ”decent”, more like everybody else.
 Trying to fit in, playing it safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting established.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This results in the loss of passion and mission. And the loss of life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, all that remains is a skeleton — an institutional framework with its positions, procedures, rituals
and traditions, yet, without the faith and the spiritual power that once made them grow and change their world.
The  machinery still runs idle for a while and may survive several generations. However, its life is
constantly declining and finally coming to an end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Followers of Jesus have no obligation to follow such a development, even less to contribute to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, Jesus is more present and active in this world than ever before since the early days, and by his Spirit
he constantly moves on, pouring out his life into ever more people, creating ever more ways to fulfill his
mission - to seek and save the lost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a radical edge, through his followers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through people like you and me.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ready to Engage</title>
      <link>http://egmontmika.com/blog/ready-to-engage/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Everyday you can choose your attitude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, the attitude of being ready. Ready to engage to the
benefit of others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ready to help&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ready to find a solution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ready to change things to the better&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ready to give hope&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ready to trust&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably,  nothing of all that is quite natural to anyone of us. Yet, we can work on it.
Day by day, week after week. Sooner or later, this attitude will become so much part of your
personality you don’t need to remind yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At that point, it’s no big deal anymore. Not for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, others get encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;
