      <title>Share a Meal</title>
      <link>http://egmontmika.com/blog/share-a-meal/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hospitality is an expression of God’s character.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our Lord is a welcoming God. He is generous, nourishing, lavish, joyful…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He is hospitable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this is what we are communicating to others when being hospital. It’s as easy as sharing a meal with a friend, a collegue, a neighbor, or a stranger. Or why not a beggar! God is indiscriminate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He is including.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your meal doesn’t have to be fancy; don’t let it be exclusive. There is no need to impress on anyone. Just share what you have, it may be abundant or little, a three-course dinner or a glas of water. Or a piece of chocolate or a banana. Just act hospitable according to the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, it’s not so much about the food, but about your attitude, what people sense when they are together with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hospitality is an expression of grace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You give people an experience of being accepted, respected, appreciated and honored. A sense of belonging without having to qualify or to argue. It breaks the power of fear and alienation and prejudice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s an expression of freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You create an environment of generosity, free from control and free from guilt and accusations. Also free from the need to impress and pretend. Allowing people to be who they are. Giving them your love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating an experience of how God is.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mentorship - Respect, Freedom and Trust</title>
      <link>http://egmontmika.com/blog/respect-freedom-and-trust/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 15 Aug 2015 06:39:19 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://egmontmika.com/blog/respect-freedom-and-trust/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Definition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Jesus commanded his disciples to go out and make disciples, they understood this as building a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;master-disciple&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; relationship. The apostle Paul translated it into his greco-roman world by instead talking about a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;father-son&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; relationship. Today, we often use the term &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;mentorship&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, it&amp;rsquo;s the same content, the same mission. It&amp;rsquo;s the mission that Jesus gave us.This is how I use this term in my blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mentorship - Respect, Freedom and Trust&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mentorship requires trust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And trust presupposes respect and freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a mentor this means respecting another person’s background and personality, her opinion, taste, religion, or whatever she brings along. Also her negative sides. It’s possible to show respect without necessarily agreeing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, it means respecting that person’s decisions.  Granting her the freedom to live her life and follow her own preferences. This includes the freedom to say “yes” or “no” to Jesus, and  also to you as her mentor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Respect and freedom - these are the preconditions, but finally it’s all about trust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trust is a relationship. You can’t buy it, neither do you get it by begging or arguing or manipulating. And you never build trust by engaging someone in your projects, thus “using” her for your own purposes. There is no such way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trust grows gradually&amp;hellip; You’ll have to build it, patiently and carefully through consistency in action, thought and motives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trust needs to be cultivated, not managed. There is a world of difference between those two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Respect, freedom and trust - you can see them in Jesus’ way of meeting people, as three expressions of his love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As his disciples and communicators of that love,  we can never depart from those three. If we ignore any of them, we lose our mentor relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, acting Jesus-like means in this context:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Showing respect, even when disrespected&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Granting freedom,  even when controlled, manipulated or threatened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building trust, even when undeserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can start out with any acquaintance, on any level of relationship. Sometimes, though, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to start from scratch. It isn’t always easy.  People aren’t easy. For you as a mentor, it’s an investment into another person’s life. An investment of your love, time and energy, although with no guarantees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However when successful, it’s an investment that produces good fruit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the way to eternity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Give to the Lord...</title>
      <link>http://egmontmika.com/blog/give-to-the-lord/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 12 Jun 2015 06:39:19 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://egmontmika.com/blog/give-to-the-lord/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Give to the Lord what he is asking you for!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one is born as a disciple of Jesus, far less a disciple maker. Yet, this is what Jesus wants us to be, a disciple and a disciple maker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, somewhere along the road, there must be a turning point, or a new start. For every one of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We may argue that we are not gifted like evangelist so and so or pastor so and so…, but that’s not the point! They do it their way, and we are asked to do it our way. There is no one else on the planet who can do it just like you and me, and fill the place that only you and I can fill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we don’t show up, the Kingdom will lack some important and unique workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We may say that we are decent and regular church goers. We have attended hundreds or even thousands of worship services, dozens of bible studies and we are supporting one or several ministries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s all quite impressive and good&amp;hellip; however, being a disciple and making a disciple has little to do with all this. Why did Jesus in his great commission not even mention all these things that today form our Christian culture and keep us busy, week after week?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question then to ask is: What are we doing? Are we disciple makers?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And by that I am not referring to the success we have achieved&amp;hellip;. we must leave that part up to the Lord. All we need to worry about is: whether we are engaging in such a task or not?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I trust this summer vacation will give us time to reflect on this question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Discipleship is not a selfish act. It’s a service to the world and to every human soul. We can’t cheat the Lord. But let us not cheat ourselves. And let us also not cheat humanity of our contribution. Instead, let us give each other and the world what we’ve got.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And to the Lord what he is asking us for!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How You Can Learn Patience</title>
      <link>http://egmontmika.com/blog/how-you-can-learn-patience/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 26 May 2015 06:39:19 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://egmontmika.com/blog/how-you-can-learn-patience/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;”I want patience, and I want it right NOW!!!”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more you yell, the more you’ll miss it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one is born with patience, in fact, the opposite is true. And there is no short-cut to get it. No button to push, no recipe to follow, no course to attend. It’s nothing money can buy…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patience is learned the hard way. Over time, and through suffering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By suffering the pain of waiting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God doesn’t seem to have a problem with it. He is the Master of patience. He can wait. For days and weeks and months and years, and if necessary, a few thousand of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patience is so much part of his character that we can’t even think of him as not being patient. Being patient with &lt;em&gt;us&lt;/em&gt;, of course!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We like that idea, yet, it’s not the end of the story. Even in this respect, he wants us to become more like him, share his godly character, and produce some good fruit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if this is his will for you and me, and if this is what we really want, why don’t we go for it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome every opportunity to train patience and get a little closer to our goal. Or even look out for these opportunities and rejoice whenever we find one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every day you can simply find some situation that makes you wait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then train yourself in the godly character of being patient. Suffer a little with that purpose in mind…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And enjoy it!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Finding Simplicity</title>
      <link>http://egmontmika.com/blog/finding-simplicity/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 15 May 2015 06:39:19 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://egmontmika.com/blog/finding-simplicity/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Simplicity isn’t the same as poverty. Poverty is a curse, simplicity is an accomplishment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The accomplishment of the wise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simplicity is obtainable. Everyone can achieve it, but not everyone will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you turn around and start following Jesus, many things will turn simpler for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t mean that you flee from the complexity of life. Rather, you face and embrace it, and then simplify by making active choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You structure your hours and plan your activities in order to follow your calling and accomplish an aim. You bring your will in line with that aim, and faithfully and diligently stick to your decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This changes your life and simplifies it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll know what time to get up and what time to go to bed. You’ll know what to engage in and what to exclude. You’ll know what kind of food you feed yourself with, even mentally and spiritually, what you want to read, listen to and look at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you consciously keep away from distractions. You practice mental hygiene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of all, you’ll change your attitude. You’ll take away your pride, insecurities and self-concerns, opening your view for the needs of others. That will save you from a lot of self-made problems. It simplifies it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up to your turning point, you allow distractions to fill your life. You don’t want to miss anything. Your days can be filled to the bursting point, but leave you heartbreakingly empty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that turning point, this will be fundamentally different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, your life is filled with a purpose and you are on your way. You can afford to miss a thousand things without loosing anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And stay simple!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Overcoming Fear</title>
      <link>http://egmontmika.com/blog/overcoming-fear/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 29 Apr 2015 06:39:19 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://egmontmika.com/blog/overcoming-fear/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The enemy of faith is fear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fearing sickness, death and final judgement, fearing failure… Fearing what others might think of me, fearing their rejection. Or their complacency. Or fearing my boss, my bills, the weather or just anything that might happen in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we meet God’s grace, the undercurrent of our life is fear. Fear makes us worry. It makes us live in a state of denial. Denying who we really are. Denying our calling. Denying that small voice in our heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Denying the presence of the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fear makes us run away into some sort of addiction or distraction. Or into a shadow career, trying to become someone or achieve something that will give us acknowledgment and security and finally somehow wipe out the fear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I experienced God’s grace and started following Jesus, this situation changed. Fear didn’t just disappear, though, but I stopped fleeing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stopped denying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I turned around and started facing it. Using my newfound weapon, the knowledge of being accepted, forgiven, and loved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trusting God and his victory. Overcoming fear.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What&#39;s the Perfect Church?</title>
      <link>http://egmontmika.com/blog/what%27s-the-perfect-church/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 15 Apr 2015 06:39:19 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://egmontmika.com/blog/what%27s-the-perfect-church/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is no such thing as a perfect church. Most Christians agree on that!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why then does it shock us when something happens in the church that absolutely should not have happened? Yes, of course, it’s okay if it happens in the world, but in the church, among the saints?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disgusting! How could this be!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But wait a minute! Why are we contradicting ourselves? In one breath we say the church isn’t perfect, and at the same time we act offended by its imperfections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isn’t it, because we have an idea of what the church “is” or really “should be”, and we expect it to match up to that picture?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the church fails. &lt;em&gt;We&lt;/em&gt; fail… Again and again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, where does that picture of the unfailing church come from?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do we get it from the Bible and the first church? Or is it just our own idealized, romantic view, our illusion of the church?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think that this is how Jesus viewed his first twelve disciples. They were anything but perfect. And it’s not the picture we get of the first church in Jerusalem either. And definitely not the churches that Paul wrote to!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would the Early Church ever have matched up to our expectations?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing is for sure, Jesus doesn’t get nervous when looking at our failures. Obviously, he knew from the beginning what kind of people we are, and must have taken that into account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, he commanded us to forgive each other. And with that he is not willing to compromise, because it is the only way we can proceed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, he gave us the mandate to forgive in his name, by his grace. This is powerful! This changes everything!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in his sight, that makes us truly ‘perfect’.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Faith Isn&#39;t Religion</title>
      <link>http://egmontmika.com/blog/faith-isn%27t-religion/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 01 Apr 2015 06:39:19 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://egmontmika.com/blog/faith-isn%27t-religion/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Following Jesus calls for faith.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, faith and religion aren’t the same. Faith isn’t religion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t confuse the two!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typically, religion is made up of two components: There is a set of statements about what a group of people, an organization, a movement, or a society consider to be true. And there are rules, rituals and traditions to follow, as applications of these truths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Faith, however, is beyond those things. It’s originated in another realm… it springs forth out of your spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Faith is your genuine trust in God, including your actions based on that trust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Faith cannot be institutional or traditional. It’s always personal, and always fresh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s rooted deep inside of you, generating qualities such as confidence, motivation, vision, courage, mental strength, patience, endurance… Faith is the ultimate motor of your actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Religion is great as long as it provides a positive, supporting environment for that faith. At its best, it amplifies your faith. Then, religion may work out for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, that’s not always the case. As you develop spiritually, the opposite can become true. In fact, at some point, religion can hinder your faith. Even kill it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While faith lets you imagine what could be possible and encourages you to act on that imagination, take risks, explore and conquer, religion reinforces the status-quo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Religion makes you fit in, not stand out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Religion is like a blanket overlaid on top of your faith. As long as you accept its limits or don’t ever recognize them, you feel fine under that blanket and enjoy whatever it offers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, for those who want to take initiative and practice an amount of freedom that is beyond those limits, the blanket turns into an iron ceiling, mentally and spiritually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you reach that point, you have only two options: stay, adapt to the status quo and let it limit your faith, or leave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case you are alive enough to leave, people may wonder whether you lost your faith. Probably, rather the opposite is true, though. Stepping out can be the very consequence of your faith. You leave because your faith requires it. What you leave is not your faith, but just a certain temporary religious, social or cultural expression of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaving is never a convenient step. It’s painful, because you’ll have to leave a familiar, secure and confirming environment. It’s like climbing an unknown mountain. From time to time, it’s necessary, though, if you want to grow as a disciple and become more fruitful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To others it may look foolish, or like a heresy or a betrayal. Or they may even envy you but decide to stay, because the price seems too high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You, however, are ready.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Disciple&#39;s Defeat and Victory</title>
      <link>http://egmontmika.com/blog/defeat-and-victory/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 18 Mar 2015 03:01:45 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;The road of discipleship is a rocky road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it’s an all but straight and upward leading walk.
If you expected it to just take you from success to success and “from glory to glory”, you’ve probably never really tried it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reality, walking that road doesn’t look that fantastic. Rather, it’s a slow and drawn-out process, much slower and way longer than we would imagine. And a lot messier than we would expect, filled with challenges, setbacks, failures, disappointments and unexpected turns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typically, it seems to lead more downward than upward. And whenever you may think you have a grip on it and finally managed to secure some kind of progress, you’ll soon find out that it really wasn’t that much of a success and that you’ll have to start all over again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lord just doesn’t follow any human standards and he has his own ways to evaluate his work and to reach his goals. He always gets there eventually, never too late, yet never too early, and never without first leading you through the deep valleys of setbacks, disappointments and hardship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s his way of refining you. It’s his curriculum for building your faith and training you for a higher cause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why you need to focus on him and trust him alone and not in your abilities or securities, neither let any opinion or circumstance distract or disappoint you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the outside, this road may indeed look like leading into failure. However, whatever you see and experience is never the complete truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the middle of a setback, there is still grace for every single step and every minute of your walk. And whatever may happen to you along the way, defeat is never the last word spoken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, that last word over your life has already been set by Jesus, long before you ever started your journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that word doesn&amp;rsquo;t spell &amp;ldquo;Victory at all times&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But &amp;ldquo;Fruit that lasts&amp;rdquo;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks, Egmont. You really pointed out many important things. The Lord just doesn&amp;rsquo;t follow any human standards. We should realise that he has his own ways, and follow them. Thanks again.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Don&#39;t Work for God! </title>
      <link>http://egmontmika.com/blog/don%27t-work-for-god/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 04 Mar 2015 03:01:45 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://egmontmika.com/blog/don%27t-work-for-god/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Don’t work &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; the Lord! Work &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; him!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why are there so many discouraged and burned-out pastors? Why do so many leave the ministry? Didn’t Jesus say that his burden would be light?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe ministry has become too heavy, because too much has been added by man. Too much of human ambitions and desires to influence and accomplish and control. Too much of duties, worries and fear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus simply expects us to follow him and make disciples. Then, naturally, we take care of each other as a family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not a problem, as long as there is no position to achieve or to keep. And no other obligations and expectations that come along with it are stealing your focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without position, you can do as little or as much as you are able to, or have faith for, or think that you can afford. In this way, your burden is self-regulating. It never grows beyond your ability and your faith. Still, it can grow, slowly enough to enable you to grow along with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t think we need to make up a great vision or strategy or plan, just because this is what all the leadership books tell us and what every great church seems to have. It&amp;rsquo;s just a guessing anyway. And a burden. Or even a curse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we don’t need to prove our spirituality or ability as a leader to anyone, neither to ourselves. The Lord leads by his Spirit and defines what success is, and he alone is to be honoured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, don’t worry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t worry about &amp;ldquo;your ministry&amp;rdquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s not yours anyway, but Jesus&amp;rsquo;. And don&amp;rsquo;t submit to wrong expectations from others. Instead, find out what the Lord already has prepared for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And join in WITH him!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you a pastor or a church leader? The stress doesn&amp;rsquo;t come from position. It comes from people who have messages from God, who call all hours every day asking for guidance, from different institutions demanding papers and other documents for everything you as a church do. It comes from making constant decisions. It comes from good meaning folks who think you should do this or that. It comes from people trying to take control of the vision God has given to you and go a direction u know is not what God has for your church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you, Dan, for your comment. You are right that position in itself would not be a problem, but the things you mention are the very things that come along with position.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Just Do It! </title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is no better way of teaching and learning than the hands-on training in real life situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you want to learn how to walk, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to start walking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you want to learn how to ride a bike, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to start biking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you want to learn how to swim, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to start swimming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter how lousy you may feel in the beginning, you&amp;rsquo;ll just have to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the same way: If you want to learn how to make a disciple, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to start making one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More sermons will not take you there, no matter how good they are.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More Bible studies will not do it, no matter how much knowledge you get.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Neither will more prayer, no matter how much more you pray&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;if you never take the first step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no other way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just do it!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dealing with the Shameful</title>
      <link>http://egmontmika.com/blog/dealing-with-the-shameful/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;There are certain things I absolutely don’t feel happy to talk about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like telling another person how I made a fool of myself, or the number of times I reacted immaturely or arrogantly. Nor do I want to speak about the time I yelled and screamed and just couldn’t control my anger. But why should I?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why should I expose myself and admit my failures? Why bother others with my private stuff?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that others have seen it, and that’s embarrassing enough. Or in case nobody did, at least I know about it and feel ashamed. And of course, the Lord knows…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there a way out?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, there is. I’ll have to talk about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Admitted, not everybody needs to know all my filth, and probably it wouldn’t be of any public interest, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if this thing is still bothering me, I need to talk about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need to take a deep breath and talk to someone I trust. And contact the person I offended or let down or betrayed, not in order to explain, but to admit, regret and apologize. Then, give myself a new start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can completely change my situation. It’s like opening a window and letting fresh air flood into my room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you in that situation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, may I suggest that you talk about it. It isn’t always easy, yet it&amp;rsquo;s worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You won&amp;rsquo;t regret it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Egmont, this is life-saving advice. I know from my own experience! Shame is a feeling among others and a very important one. But we need to go beyond it, because if we get stuck in shame we will run away and hide and the cause of shame will never be dealt with. If we dare to accept the shame and go beyond it and take the risk of opening up and showing ourselves as we are (with the less nice sides included) we give others a chance to give us that healing acceptance that is the key to restauration. I can&amp;rsquo;t help of thinking of pastor Robert Ekh in this context. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if that was the inspiration of your text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&#34;egmont-mika:570519d7eb79f2aae2ba5720c1e610bb&#34;&gt;Egmont Mika&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you, Sara, for your fine commentary. You are right, this post fits very well into our situation in Uppsala, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t think of that, when I wrote it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ranking Jesus&#39; Words</title>
      <link>http://egmontmika.com/blog/ranking-jesus-words/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2015 03:01:45 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://egmontmika.com/blog/ranking-jesus-words/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Jesus said: “Go and make disciples!” As a disciple of Jesus, how do those words rank on your list?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you think of your work, your spare time, your daily routines, and weekly obligations, including your spiritual engagements and church activities, where on that list would you place your response to Jesus’ words about making disciples?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe you have already made some disciples, or just one, or maybe none. Or maybe you are just about to make one, or planning to. Or have tried and given up, or never tried, but would like to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes our routines, habits and obligations crowd out the most important things in life. And most often our church culture with all its programs, activities and obligations keeps us from caring enough for another person and from taking the time, the effort and the sacrifice that it takes to make a disciple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, whom shall we blame?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter how glorious or how lousy you and I may feel about it, this is a new year and today is a new day and along with it comes the freedom for a new decision and a new start. It’s up to you and me how we respond to Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disciple making isn’t easy for anyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, it’s possible for those who rank it high on their list.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Jesus Community</title>
      <link>http://egmontmika.com/blog/a-jesus-community/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2015 06:39:19 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://egmontmika.com/blog/a-jesus-community/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;rsquo;t take an apostle or a prophet, an appointed church leader or a church planter in order to form a simple community of disciples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My wife and I do not hold any of these offices and we never formally started a church. In fact, we never attempted to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there has been an informal community of disciples around us ever since we opened up our family and our home and let others join us in our walk with Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has been going on for more than 40 years and it still continues: Informal gatherings for meals, worship, bible study, prayer, counselling, working on a project, celebrations, hikes and other outdoor activities, parties, traveling&amp;hellip; and of course, personal mentoring and baptism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of these people have been living with us in our home for a year or two, or just a few months, some of them have been working with us daily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, we never had a membership list, appointed leaders, a board of elders, a budget, a constitution, a statement of faith, a list of core values, a mission statement - neither any conflict, splitting, economical problem, or burned out. And we never had any vision other than the one that Jesus gave his disciples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably, most people wouldn&amp;rsquo;t call it a &amp;ldquo;real church”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, there has been a constant flow of new connections, of teaching and modeling, and a building of community. In Jesus&amp;rsquo; name and under the guidance of his Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of those who have been around us during these years now live in other countries and other continents. With some of them we still are in touch, per email, through social media and through actually visiting each other. Flights are cheap nowadays and make it possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This wonderful bunch of people - we may call it community - is both very little and quite large, anything between two or three and nearly a hundred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s both a local family and a worldwide community. It&amp;rsquo;s well defined by the people who are actually meeting at a certain place and time, but it&amp;rsquo;s also hard to grasp due to its openness and flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not a brand, an organisation, a building, or an office, yet, it&amp;rsquo;s not just an idea in our heads either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s kept together by Jesus as Lord and by the personal relationships created by him. It&amp;rsquo;s very real and it surely is glorious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a Jesus community.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>God&#39;s Family - an Institution?</title>
      <link>http://egmontmika.com/blog/gods-family-an-institution/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2014 06:34:40 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://egmontmika.com/blog/gods-family-an-institution/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;God wants a family. Yet, man builds him an institution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you a father or a mother? Then imagine what it would feel like, if your children, as they grow up, turned your family into an institution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What would that be like?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Formal membership instead of family relations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Organized meetings and programs at special times of the week instead of common family life&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rented facilities instead of homes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Formal, elected leadership instead of parenthood&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Board meetings instead of family counsel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Democratic voting instead of common agreement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Symbolic, formalistic eating and drinking instead of real meals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tithings, and offerings whenever you come together… (The list goes on.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, as a father or a mother, would you build your family like that? And as a child or a grandchild, would you like to carry on with that kind of a heritage? Is this what you want to hand on to your own children and grandchildren?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I doubt it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does the Lord feel about it? Is this how we best express our testimony about him who is our Father and who loves us and cares for us? Is this a true and convincing expression of his kingdom?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, I doubt it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why are we doing this? Why are we doing this to our Father in heaven, and to each other, and to the ones we disciple, to our spiritual children?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For how long do we want to carry on? For how long do &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;? – For sure, there is a better way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be a family!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not difficult, and it’s not far away. You can start out with two or three others and right where you are. Any follower of Jesus can take the initiative, or join someone else and contribute. No matter, if inside or outside the institution. You don&amp;rsquo;t need a building or a program or a vision or a name or a constitution or a logo or a budget or a ministry or an office&amp;hellip; And you don&amp;rsquo;t need permission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It just takes a decision and initiation. Would that be a too hard or adventurous thing to do? What could possibly hinder you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The choice is yours and mine. And also the responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;
