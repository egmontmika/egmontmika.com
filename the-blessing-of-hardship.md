vvvvvAre you looking for security, comfort, well-being and acknowledgment?

Then following Jesus might not be the right choice for you.

Jesus never invited anyone to a safe journey. Neither did his Father. The Bible is filled with stories about men and women who knew God and faithfully followed him on a rather bumpy road. Just think of Abraham, Joseph, Moses, Elijah, David, Isaia, Jeremia, Jesus, Paul… Their lives were filled with all kinds of dangers, hardship, risks, drop-backs, agonies and persecution.

Jesus had such a life, and he didn’t promise his followers anything else. Least of all comfortable life.

However, this is what millions seem to expect and daily pray for. And churches do their best to make Christianity appear a pleasant experience.

In case we let worship services be the only or foremost expression of our faith and of what it means to follow Jesus, what then do we communicate?

In case we filter out the hardship, the pain, the struggle, the risk-taking, the dropbacks, we end up with an artificial smile that doesn’t stand the test of everyday life. And the test of authenticity.

On the other hand, if we intentionally face those trials and try to overcome them by strengthening our faith, by putting our spiritual weapons into practice and by standing side by side as brothers and sisters, we make an astonishing discovery.

In fact, overcoming these negative experiences are forming the very pavement of the road we are walking on.

The road that leads to our destination.

What a blessing!
